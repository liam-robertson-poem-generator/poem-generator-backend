<text>My dad was the size and shape
Of Hammett's Continental Op. He costed blueprints,
But didn't have his father's
Subcutaneous way with heavy engineering,
The investigator's tact,
The what to squeeze and when to smack
The fractious into tolerance.
The artefacts my dad and me have jiggered in our time
Because his father didn't live to say: this way.
What Pinkerton's men will twist my ingenuity to fit
Their faces, their facts and cases.</text>
