<text>The agency pries and prides itself on that
It's to prise the snapsprung velvet
Of what's taken for your heart
Open and apart. Random quantifers
Sifted for primes. Aerial grey
In a stand of stone pine. Surprise:
Four-and-twenty haircuts analyzing pies.
It's not that secret priors are more keen on using
Pliers for extraction than the opposite faction,
That they stoke pyres in other parts
With piles of abstract flesh
The stuff their leader plies us with
The liberty they prize.
