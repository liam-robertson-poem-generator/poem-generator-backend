<text>So in goes Capn Rabbie with his
Albatross and dodo feather-fletched patent harpoon.
Don't fret my dear, he never felt a thing:
That screaming as they flensed him
Was an autonomic reflex, the spiking pulse in demi-morts
When we took their hearts and fenced them
To the clinics (fetched a packet)
See? One eye flecked with gold, one with blood.
