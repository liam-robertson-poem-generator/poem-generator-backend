<text>Two no-use sleuths embarked at Leith
In sharkskin suits their pumpkin soup's cried over.
In the roads, some sloppy sloops were
Happy slapping spilt wave scoops of milky firth.
Anyway, they're just snoops. One stoops to needle
Stooks of facts and check for coopered stow-aways.
- I say they're spooks: vice-presidential sycophants
on a thousand scoots a day expenses.
- but they drink like boy scouts: wee gruntles
slurping hoffs and stouts in the cocktail bar. Nae style;
and then those gusts of brussels sprout. Soused, they are,
and we're still in port. Come on, spruce up.</text>
