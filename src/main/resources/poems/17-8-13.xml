<title>"First, We Take Manhattan" - Leonard Cohen</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>'They sentenced me to twenty years of stardom'
Said the system
'For snorting all their weapons-grade cocaine'.
Passengers in the cage
Of a high-velocity elevator
Disappearing up some tower's nostril
Attempt to break glass over switch
Marked STRUCTURAL REFORM and find it's armored.
PARODY we've pushed; now what does JEOPARDY entail?
The tower has been hijacked
By well-connected men.</text>
