<text>"An audience is oxygen to a poet, and the most effective
way of showing your feelings is to deprive him of air"
- Rita Goldberg, Harvard University

Some critics eat thristles
For gristle and grace
But the thirls of authority
Frazzle them numb
To the thrills in things.
As their oxygen thins
They suffocate folk
Who'd not stifle a yawn.</text>
