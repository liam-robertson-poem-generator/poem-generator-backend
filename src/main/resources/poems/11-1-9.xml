<text>No boy-scout, the corpulent quart
In the second-hand suit, sempiternally soused,
His snout in the red-eye and stout, his red ears
A-quiver and -sprout, going round
In his souped up, re-treaded sedan. Go on, scoot!
Time you spruced up your corporate
Thing: when's the last time you
Spooked a wheen horses, stooped to recover
The Key at the Scene, snooped in his rooms
As the serial cannibal made his way home
Down the chimney (the billowing soot was
A Clue) and scooped a conviction?</text>
