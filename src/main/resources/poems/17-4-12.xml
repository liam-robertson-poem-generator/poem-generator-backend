<title>Cuss
</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>You will buy on the cusp
And sell in your cups;
In silly wee deals
Burn your fingers to clumps.

With the back hand it cuffs you
With the forehand it cuts,
For if life's a bear, you're not
Its cub: you're a klutz.

And may all the cunts round you
Be just like yoursel, except mair:
Cults and kirks of you. One clucks
In the pulpit: "prepare for the rapture!"

Och aye. When the door clunks
That's your fingers in it;
but mind when you curse,
It'll boomerang back. And this
Is the crux of it: go and unravel,
You cardigan.</text>
