<title>Close but no</title>

<text>Was it the way the slub silk
Wing of that kimono
Happed my face
As she stuck some beer in a glass,
The definite hip against my arm,
Made one diner smirk, the other
Don't say sulk but stiffen,
Brought back the dentist's help in candid cotton, so intent
On viewing the fine spelunker's progress down my root canal
She put her right breast to my left ear?
I near hoped they struck necrosis, not to notice
One self-inflating life-raft had commenced emergency drill.
Encore to surfing Berlusconi's box at 2 a.m.
A second each for sixty channels.
In the high fifties a dame in her forties
Beachwear kissed a woman half her age.
In the time it took Matt Damon to clean up the CIA,
Neither had so much as opened their mouth,
The younger one still dressed up warm. In the land of suck
Their screen was spattered with ads for services
From that skunk syllable, whose users skulk,
Where they snuck and slunk to relieve themselves
Of salt and semen. Two goals into a league game
They still snog like adolescents.
Then one enjoys the other's breasts, in spite
Of the daunting camera. Enough:
It must be love.</text>
