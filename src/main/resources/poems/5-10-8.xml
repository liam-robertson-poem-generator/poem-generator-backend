<title>On my First Sight of the Vine, at 21</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Whatever I might have pictured, it was not
In that scar-ploughed roadside plot
A show of hands.
Hands mostly bone, hard-strained with sinew
Clawed the sun, as taproots
Inoculate rock. Amputees, no:
Amputations of
Phylloxerated emperors'
Warriors, in whose austere respect,
Anything but, I drank.
