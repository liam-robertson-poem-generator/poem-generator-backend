<text>A zoo
's a zoom
ysee, mzee,
The varmints nest in the arc of the lens
So close up you can smell 'em
Their vertebrae and vellum.
When's
Feeding time? Who's she?
A sow in a skiff
A pig in a scow
Who'll wallow in offal
And stow like a sofa.
The slough in the trough'll
Be scuttling bilge
And is that where she's
Rooting for truffle?
The keepers strew
What butchers slew
A huntress could spew the dead meat,
Clip a screw, but the skew of the bars
Stops her swipe. And you can't
Sue for war.</text>
