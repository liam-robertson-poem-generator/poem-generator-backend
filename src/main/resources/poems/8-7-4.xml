<title>Angkor Sweat
</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>What's in a nem but greens and prawns and carrots ?
What's in this shirt of cotton, sweat sodden ? Not
That bosom swelling from the collar bones
Of the dancer by the moat at Angkor Wat
But something rancid. It is
Myself. It is my self.</text>
