<text>The tyke was a wee Jack Russell
Barrel-chested and bow-legged.
My dad had it put down when my mother died.
The trike was a big maroon thing
- pavements only, no two-wheelers -
With a big kind of beige breadbasket
At the back, for toys and messages.
I mind it going completely out of control down from Angus Oval,
Me having to take a header through a hedge.</text>
