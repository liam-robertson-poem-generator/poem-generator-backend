<text>Clouds offload at the pass, move on.
Clowns at customs stood in grey
Crowds of witness to hexagonal heaven.
The king croons karaokilly, molar crowns abuzz,
Retweeting to demotic headphone cowls.
Some scale the cwms to flee the dead skunk, the gone coon scent;
The air cools quickly though. One cowers against a rock.
Mineral cubes and clews of fungal filament:
The cures are there. The cure to what?
Cows and camels root out the clues
As wrecking crews turn to the constitution
Itâ€™s not that the opposition coos and preens,
Or takes its cues from just any media moghul, but
The queues you see are for winter sales,
For a tropical cruise.
