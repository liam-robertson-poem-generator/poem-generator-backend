<text>Cow - my wetnurse! Land of milk!
Packets and tins afloat like Noah's navy.
Six days rehearsing the first word of Nostratic
End in bits for the Saturday Irish stew
Floured and quivering Turkish delight.
Childhood ends with a shlook like school milk.
Now you shamble among the urban veggies
Like Abel's ghost in downtown Madras.
We're afraid to touch you.
