<text>A film about a paedophobe
Gone short of medication
On the dole, in a derelict building,
And the one with the 2nd-hand teddy bear
Doesn't know not to talk to uncle.
And I had to stay till the end,
Which was not so droll,
For the young director had come all the way
From Seoul to present it
And he looked so happy,
And his partner so pretty,
I didn't want to spoil their night by walking out.
