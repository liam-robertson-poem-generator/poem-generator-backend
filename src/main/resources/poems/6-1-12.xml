<text>For the founts of digital noughts and crosses
Who foots the bill?
Boffins frownce their brow as factoid
Fruits of their endeavour
Flounce across the glass in seqined
Gowns with mermaid flukes.
The show flouts one convention with another
As ever. With flutes of solid steel we drill
For solar power. The viewer pays.
