<title>The Way of the Words, for Nicolas Bouvier</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>A wilderness is music on deaf ears.
That Persian city, Persepolis,
Where fire sang in Zoroaster's bones,
Has clogged the carburettor. Entropy.
Zend Avesta, if I've got it right,
Was like Sanskrit in some Aramaic script.
Zain was the letter zed, a word for weapon;
Then Marco Polo and three wise men,
Now Parsee in the Arabic alphabet. I can't keep up.
Shiraz! Where are those flasks of throaty wine
You used to do? The stuff we stained your rugs with?
And what has become of those subtle women
Who wouldn't take the veil? Omar Khayyam!
Such music in a wilful wilderness.</text>
