<text>Glued to the box
Though you grued at the headlines:
Groomed for abuse, as in curried,
Or surgically gowned,
Grooved with disposable sharps,
Left on the ground, in a swing park,
Out of her gourd. You think, Hobbes:
Whatever the object
Of a man's appetite or desire,
Is what he, for his part, calls
Good.
