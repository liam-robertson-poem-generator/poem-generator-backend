<text>Assiduously fail in every thing you do; the holy drinker,
Vin santo, cantuccini. Roses flail,
Restrained on thorn collars from candles on this terrace
Where I watch that grill till the coals collapse,
Though one frail basket bears a spark,
Its twindling bark, to the burning ghatts
And pilgrims ferried, drop by drop, to a paradise
That so recalls
This place.</text>
