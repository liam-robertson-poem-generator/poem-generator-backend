<text>This one sagged into gravity,
Snagged on a thorn. Sad
It's scarred for life.
Roses reared and sparred on a breath of breeze
Sparrows slagged each other off.
Car door slammed. A masked man
Got stabbed outside a shop. Tinned beans were scarce
But who'd have starved? The sinner
Salved his scabbed and crottled conscience:
He should have scrammed when tellt,
But that's him slabbed. A skald
Scanned the foreshore, spanned the firth and starred
The north, its soggy strand, a stricken
Stand of pine. Water running out and,
Through his fingers, sand.
