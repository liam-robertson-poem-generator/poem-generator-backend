<title>Limeys</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Taut canvas, creaking sheets
And a tot of yo-ho-ho
With a splash of lime.
And then the rhetorical titter and tatter,
The taunt we were taught by tabloid
Rags we topped our flaming cocktails with
Or used and tossed in the bilge.
The settlements we torched!
Till someone talked and somebody else
Got topped. Oh well,
Back to the crossword.
