<text>Wells is deep. He does cheap
Fiction wherein warts and wens
Denote the wems and sins of
Those he welds to
Weds and pledges
In the wends and twists of
Plotted webs strung tight.
Ah but the whelms and runnels of prosody
Have to be cut for the stream and the slope.
When's a good time? - I'nt it just.
And where's a good place.
