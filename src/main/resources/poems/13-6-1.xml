<text>Twenty-odd years after that twenty-odd year war
A cormorant surfaces in fog,
Ring round the neck.
A diamond-eyed, black blonde in negative. The darkroom feels
Petals? A puckered heart? No - 
Swelling lips. In one eye 'enemy combatant'
And in the other Khieu she won't live up to.
I've done better shoots but I've never seen clearer, Madame
Bleary Windyhair
Fresh out of sleep.</text>
