<title>East of the Urals</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Quell too much and the system seizes;
Too much slack and it falls apart.
Most of this fuel-oiled electrification
Goes straight between the birch trees, Moscow time.
There's yet a pendular sway, some pulse and burden,
An iron mother; me in this berth;
And all the lullabies she cannot sing.
