<text>A sneer glassed in a pub fight
Sorely gashed. He'd have
Grassed on his granny. Yet,
I grant, to be faced with graft
On graft - that's hard.
To get gaffed and hoist
From your element, gassed
In the clear air like some dogfish,
To have gasped it before you'd
Grasped the sequence - that too.
Syllabary sometime
Yet can rhyme with celebrate.
Gaffed in your sheets, the trunk,
By this urgent gift, a blushing
Graft, insatiable grant
That graced and grassed on us.
Quite right. Otherwise desire
Would've been glassed off, never
Grasped or gashed. Never more
Than its own ghost put to sleep
In chaos.
