<text>A knife can do division and subtraction.
Where there's life
A seer will see a sign
A spear can find the usual
Smear of proteins
A fuss about nothing
The sneer of the blade
In human relations
You men of vision - women too -
Big gondoliers who steer your statecraft
Through the sphere of spin
Here I salute you.
Hoi!</text>
