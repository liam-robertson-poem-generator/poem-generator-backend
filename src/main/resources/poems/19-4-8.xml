<title>Neuilly</title>

<text>Un bisou, un bisou! A nous
A nous, a nous! Just out of school
Nostalgic already; three of them
Posed at midnight on a flower-
Pot balcony, just out of reach.
Couldn't so much as blow them a kiss
For fear of blowing dinner
Before I won to the far from
Cheap hotel. Where I picked up
Kawabata, "The Sleeping Beauties".
Honi soit qui pas mal y pense.</text>
