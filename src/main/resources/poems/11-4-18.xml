<text>That I should take
Your name in vain
To the christening stars
Of every blooming year is the fortunate
The unfortunate thing.
St Brendan's skull turned turtle as the sea
Withdrew in a sharp intake of breath
Between W. 3rd and E. 4th St
So high and dry. But don't you fear
It's coming back</text>
