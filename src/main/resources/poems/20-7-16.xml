<text>Leaving work, "my mind bruised with it"
I thought to write, but that
Is a symptom, not description,
Of bruising of the spirit in bureaucracy,
Confined to its ineptitudes, and one of them,
As a bruise on the leg disfigures in disabling.
All that adrenaline and no one to thump.
All that testosterone, and who were those
Darkling women with the rusty hair?
Mother and child? Though in the daughter's brow
The genes gave way to geometry.
That tawny tawse, I could feel it in my hand -
Conflation of the French toison
With punishment for thinking o't. Go home.</text>
