<text>The dyer's hand has auburn cuticles: would you believe it?
The chief technical officer dyes his hair.
He'll have one o thae 1960s helmet driers they used on wifies
That dried their tongue to stop their gossip. Not his:
He drives an orotund coach and horses through discussions,
Dives in at the deep end, yah yah yah.
Dines on ancient anecdotes worth at most a dime a gross.
His missus dials and rings an empty office. Dies alone.</text>
