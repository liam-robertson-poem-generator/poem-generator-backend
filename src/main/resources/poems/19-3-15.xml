<title>Arjuna and Draupadi in Glasgow</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>I am the southwest wind
I salt the air and soak the earth.
These ravelled clouds of mine shake out
the tenemental warp and weft
of sulphured sandstone rows.
A rustheap rolls up, bringing you,
you in a saffron thundercloud
your heels that press the ochre boards
as tensile rain hits petals, whose
pubescence tries to hold to it:
those drawn bows.
Here at last I can see neither
bowstring, wrist nor flight, and so
my shot bends like a sleepy fruit
burns along the fuse you lit
to its target: war.
