<text>The onomatopoeia
Met the patented device
Around 1900, when both were about 50.
RNA, RNA : zip, hook, unzip.

Took off with the order of bomber jackets
For US aviation. Zippo lighter
Zoning Improvement Program
Unpack a coca logo file
On the zip code of Cambodia
A baw hair caught in the fly of Henry's Levis
On that great big Harley in the sky.</text>
