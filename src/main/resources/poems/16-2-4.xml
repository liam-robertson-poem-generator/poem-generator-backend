<title>Conjugate</title>

<text>A stairhead glimmer through the cold.
We stretch and roll, and the cover's off,
Which makes my flesh and goose-flesh rise.
'To his Mistress, Going to Bed' would sing
like old wine in my younger skin,
where time is drawing maps.
The brain is playing favourite tunes
That skimmer and gloam with the sheen of your skin.
The nouns decline like Roman gods.
Hold on and let them all
Go. We're down to verbs and prepositions
That steer us till we take the swell.
