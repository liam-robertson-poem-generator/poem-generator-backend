<text>One of those hangovers
From artesian wells.
Eating crab with chopsticks
And the cab didn't show
So the owner - also Chinese - drove us back.

Bowles had told me a tale Wong said was bullshit:
Frenchman in Mauritius took an escort for a week;
Couldn't pay the bill, didn't make his flight - 
Chopped into little pieces by the triad.
It happened to me.</text>
