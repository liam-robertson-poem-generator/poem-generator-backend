<text>The body is simple and good
It is always the infant, always itself -
Though sometimes two rivers will find the one bed.

The mind is nothing more than
Nothing wrapped in a rainbow flag.
And nothing was wrong:
Not these lights, these limbs.

The crimson sign that you impressed on me
Was fever on the wind.
The riverboat beats upstream, the shoals divide.

This is my body, and to understand
The just conclusion that you drew
It hurt like a toothache, till I found
That it had made me the simplest sign of all.</text>
