<text>At next to worst it's as when, after a liquid lunch
Prolonged in hope the rainstorm might relent,
And having forgotton how to reduce the volume on your headphones
While trying to sing a completely different song to your companion,
You happen into a swarm of angry bees that's been blown off course.
