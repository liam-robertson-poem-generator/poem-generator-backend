<title>Which Is Not How It Works</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>She backs up, hits Send and blacks out,
Banks on the redacted blanks
Protecting her from blasts out of the blue.
The bass, or sea-wolf, hunts in shoals
That fishermen track like bats.
They don't land the little brats with baited brass.
Think how chitinous bracts cradle the bud.
A chainsaw barks in the wood.
