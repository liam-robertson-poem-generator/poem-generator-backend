<text>A sack of spuds
A shelf of skulls
A book of stubs
A book of Kells
A jig of slurs
A jigger of suds
A drawer of studs and cuff-links
A quiver of real or imagined slights and snubs
A laundry bag of scrubs
A can of squirms
The stone he stuns the fish with
Slugs of the Order of Merit
Surds and sums
A contract signed by McQuitty and Sons
To honour. Perhaps.
The songs he strums on envelopes
The biro scuds across in dingy snugs
On weekday afternoons. The barman stirs
A bloody mary, for his breakfast. Tudor crisps
Are on the house. The sun is hot
But not in Glasgow. Not today.
