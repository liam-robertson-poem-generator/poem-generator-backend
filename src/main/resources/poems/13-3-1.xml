<text>I'm going to buy a shaw
Clear some larch and pine in the middle
Build a house like the Quakers in New England
Wi nary a nail nor drop of glue
But joints that settle till they're more like grafts
And I'll stay there till it's four hundred year old
And me a sprightly ninety
Hearing the breakers braille the rocks at Cleadale.</text>
