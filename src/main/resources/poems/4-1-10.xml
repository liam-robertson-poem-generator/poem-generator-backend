<text>What syntax grappled and grammar moved
In Burns the numbers mowed like reek
That mouthed and bloomed in kinky neon,
Mooed across the Firth of Clyde in a paddle-boat steam shriek.
Was that a buzzard mewed?
A burly barman mused and shone his shots.
The stoker mooned and built his mound of dowts.
No in the mood. No way to let off steam.
