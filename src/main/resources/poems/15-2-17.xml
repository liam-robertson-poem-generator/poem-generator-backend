<text>Just as, when the interpretation's rubbish,
The chief interpreter puts his headphones down
And rubs the bridge of his nose with index finger and thumb,
I'd set aside the yoke of collarbone and shoulderblade
And wriggle back into the original egg, an unmade bed,
At four on a winter's morning,
The sunrise yolk reconstituted, the bleary white, divided
Yin and yon, yirsel division cataracting
Through family albums to primal stew
Cuddling to keep warm, each with a finger in the other's ear
To stop the alarm clock.
