<text>When Pud was nine his dad died. Mid-term break, you know ?
And Devlin calls him to the teachers' table,
Talks to him, still eating, Pud stood there,
Greitin as he come back, only time.
Next he's got me in a finger lock
Guiding me round the playground like reversing a toy ar-tick.
Then when I pubbed in Kenya with the Irish
(Old man minding the car was like a blanket around a stork)
That was the night a beautiful wee scrubber stood me a beer,
Glowing from the bar as they explained (now she'll be deid)
Well it turned out one of the Michaels
Came across Pud in New York.</text>
