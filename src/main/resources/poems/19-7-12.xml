<title>In a Crowded Lift
</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Warm and damp, the leather welts
The weather wets her corky hair
Wents are missing roads I took
Wefts flash across them.

Whence? I don't know.
What for? Not for
Meeting needs and making more.
Where to? Oot
Forever. Hence the pencil.</text>
