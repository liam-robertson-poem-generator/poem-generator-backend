<text>Rigoletto: De Niro dabs an eye
(No drabs to do it for him: he's a family man)
Sean Connery drags himself along on gore
"It'sh a tough job..." Heard it, Sean. Though I admit
Two drams, two deadmen does seem harsh when the Hoover Dam's abrim
With bathtub gin. De Niro damns their eyes, even Mrs Untouchable,
Who darns bullet holes in her husband's coat and tuts at powder burns.
And aren't Cupid's dards just like that? A darning needle
With a 12-bore kick. "Junior! The radio says dad's coming home.
The dahl is cooked, and the popodoms. How's the rice?</text>
