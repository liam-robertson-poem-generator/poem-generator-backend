<text>The pews are for losers, for old prudes and prunes
Each galley slave moans and pulls with chained hands the ark
Of the nave of the kirk toward the pulpit
Eppur non si muove. The nothing it proves
Is the point. These parcimonious pools of light
Where janitor trout and dragonfly hover
Where plumes denote the male, the upquark,
Powers and dominations, diphthong vowels,
What prowls their periphery when prows are wrought
While ploughs are worked and worked
The mortar pounds, the mortar pounds
The pools evaporate.
