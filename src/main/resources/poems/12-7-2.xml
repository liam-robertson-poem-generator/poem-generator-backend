<text>You don't live like a gerbe on the retina
But draw on me till like that pepper jasmine
From the little terracotta you cover the entire wall
Where swifts in hundreds skirmish with their shadows
And there's nothing left of me and the birds have gone
But you keep wringing bloom from that corded stem</text>
