<title>From a Louse</title>

<text>Great poet o the puddin race!
Get that grin aff your pin-up face.
To harbour me is no disgrace
For any lady:
It's rare to pioneer a place
No ploughed already!
'Tae see oursels as others see us'?
That's common sense. That's the police -
Hauf blin (take that fae one wi feelers
In the back o's heid).
Crazed banes! I hear your thin blood wheeze
You'll soon be deid.</text>
