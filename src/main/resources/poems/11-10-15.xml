<title>Pause
</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>As her Achilles tendons lay on his
Like a bow on the fiddle string
Waiting for a nod from the conductor
That had sidled off for breakfast
With the second violin, the brass and timpani,
Who would sire a silence on their memory?
The squire and escutcheon waiting on an empty runway
For every leafy tournament, for every spire of green.</text>
