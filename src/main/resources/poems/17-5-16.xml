<text>Where's my kag? No answer. My cagool?
The neighbours think of anarchist hoods and picture a balaclava.
Say that, though, and they might hear baclava? or bacal&#224;, and wonder
What I want with a cake exuding sugar, or a fish that's stiff with salt.
Ah, but the freight of simple words like crag,
Or cargo, come to that: Wells Fargo on TV, Stagecoach and
In a tenement bath that polythene cargo boat
Whose motherly hold took all my enamelled cars and never sank,
When cars and cargo boats were shearing off the glacier Glasgow.</text>
