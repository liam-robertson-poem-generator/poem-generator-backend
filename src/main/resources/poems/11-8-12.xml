<title>Exchange Value</title>

<text>When straights in suits, their shaded gaze,
Steaks instead of ears, close cranial scrapes,
Bone up on the chicanes and straits
A renegade lone ranger strafes,
Gerrymandered stripmall scapes,
The final frontier,
What slakes a thrust, what even for a minute
Sates the principal is a target.
For both our sakes, let's hope
The safe's a secret. Hopes and snakes.
The stakes, as Henry the homicide bomber quips,
Are low. They're what we've got.
He skates of course, his slate's as clean as karma.
Undelete? And what about our fingerprints?
What if one of those losers states her case?
We are on the wrong side and we won
The usufruct of space. Now now, no need to look so fierce
Though it might be time to make ourselves scarce.
