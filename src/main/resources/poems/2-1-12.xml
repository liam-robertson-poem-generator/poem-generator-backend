<title>Bannockburn</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>De Bruis and de Bohun: two brutes
Whose grandfaithers squabble at meat in Valhalla.
The bloops of the bog and the brooks
Of the bickering burn. With the armies in order
de Bohun, mailed fist and missile ranging in,
Boots up. The charger boosts him through his pawns
At the shirt-sleeve king, who ought to leave
But jouks the lance-head, stirrup-stands
And deals the knicht twa beauts to the heid.
Game over.</text>
