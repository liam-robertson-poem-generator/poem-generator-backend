<text>My Bentley slews on gravel
Somebody spews out the off side
Puke strews the roses
The steering screws to full lock, which rather
Skews the apprehension of oncoming trees.
Ah well. The driver sues for peace with the police
Then scours his cell and sours in custardy,
His just desserts. Yet stounds of pain
And nightly sounds of non-consensual sex:
Who ordered that? It was only a motor.
The sloughs our penal system stows
The righteous sows that run it.
The scows of State: big dirty barges in the night
Their honoured scowls and schools of thought,
The bar stools on the bridge.
Dad brings the cin&#233;, mum forgets the spools
Again. She soothes and consoles him
But near enough swoons when the boss shows up.
As all attention zooms, I've seen
Zoos with visitors more discreet.</text>
