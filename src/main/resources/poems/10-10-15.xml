<title>Census
</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>A billion Anglophones, a billion Muslims
A billion Chinese, a billion Christians
A billion subcontinentals, one more
Living on dust - that's six.

Two billion ageing, three billion women,
Dire diarrhoea, four billion children
The dear dirempt in sunken straits and drier,
Deconditioned air. The lions hone
Their cutter claws and drank the well dry.</text>
