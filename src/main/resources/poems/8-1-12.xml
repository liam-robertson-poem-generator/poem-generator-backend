<title>The Promised Landfill</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Home is gone and cleared the mortgage
If it were dust to sift
Not the sliver and slither of others' leavings
The janitor's poems of every day
The wrapper on the can
Tee-shirt on a scavenger
Dead to the dump
The noose
The mair can dream
The hindoo cast off system
Knouts of need to whip you past
That old Plotinian nous
And the stink of it
DEUS EST
AMOR QUI PLUS
HABITUS MAGIS LATET
God is not
The garbage. God is
In the garbage.
