<text>Gerry Magennis shared a room with Viktor.
Viktor lounged in bed all day smoking and saying Blyad.
A whirlwind known as Viktor's Buryat Girlfriend
Saw to the rest. Gerry's girlfriend Sendy
Looked a bit too much like Garbo for anybody's good.
To him the rouble was the Panamanian Gumbean;
The Finns who puked in Leningrad hotels -
'They're making it up', he said. 'They're making WHAT up?'
'that language: it doesn't exist'. Viktor! Gerry
Magennis! Leningrad! Better a brilliant has-been
Than a never was.
