	<title>Earless in Tara</title>

	<text>The Flight of the Earls
When each took fright
Abandoning churls
To their fate and the pap
Of the taters. The Oils
(Had they landed in Brooklyn) became
"Les huiles", big wheels,
With their buckets of emerald.
To each his heiress. Hers
An ell of linen, his
AN L-plate sporran.</text>
