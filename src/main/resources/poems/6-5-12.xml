<text>You want to send a farce on tour,
You have to pack and package it:
Props and pranks, airholes. A deck-hand
Faffs with tape and string.
The flaps won't meet. The postman
Franks a bulge, that farts at him. Take two.
The player fasts, subsists on two plain facts
Washed down with flasks of fennel tea ad lib.
The cast now fits, their flanks are skinny;
Still, no fat's no fun - ask Julius C.
But this, now, this plays out in council
Flats and schemes, in grand apartments.
Work it up from Morse,
From a one-dimensional fax.
