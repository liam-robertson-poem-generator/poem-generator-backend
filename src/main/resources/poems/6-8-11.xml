<text>Looking to faze his fate
The singer feigns a feint,
Fails of course, though maybe the tune fares on.
The curvature of nothing
Is just a phase, a rhetoric,
Coin a phrase to plumb it:
It flares, it falls in dust and ice, a comet.
But even that elliptical vector frays,
The sun it frames, the Dantean flames of hell -
The singer flays them with the flails of grammar.
It's allarmingly Mallarmean.</text>
