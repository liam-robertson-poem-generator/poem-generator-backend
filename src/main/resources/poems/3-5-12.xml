<text>Mist on the pass between
Paps of whin. The downward path's
Been dealt a hand of different pasts
In guns and ghosts. Parade-ground soldiers
Prance, impassive, muffle pants and grunts.
Your doctor palps and listens. Perhaps,
She says, it's nothing. Pats your wrist,
Packs her little bag. Intricate pacts unravel
Pax in terra. Killing pranks and pratfalls.
Henry parks the cash and planks the bullion.
Some loser plants the body parts that don't add up.
