<text>Whoever squawks is dead - two palindromes,
Two equilateral, sonic anagrams,
One hypothetical, one proleptic.
Lead type is movable, time is not. The clock
In little ice-age Bruges,
Implacable stork - not that one with the snorkel
In the Bosch-pink body sock. Who put
The phlegm in Flemish, that I get:
The merchant taking stock; some yokel, his cotton
Smock and dandy stalk of wheat.
But where did they get flamingoes, flimflam
And flamenco dance
To stamp out the fire it started?</text>
