<text>The pack fanned out
Its dealer blind
To the dark
We blunder in
Thick livid rain.
What prank, you wonder
Brought down the wrath?
A fitba where it says
Keep off the grass
That's down to moss
Like dental plaque on raw
Concrete inside the boat pond
In a play park where
Wee pirates walked the rhododendron plank.
