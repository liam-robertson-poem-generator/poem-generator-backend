<title>Occupation</title>

<text>A sudden, probing silence
From the table next to ours
Echoes along Argyll Street.
Cat got your tongue, gents?
Get back to base. Yes,
Before you acquired that Powell drawl
And a taste for local seafood
Our mum made soup and scones
For the Faslane Peace Camp.
We'll see the back of youse yet.
