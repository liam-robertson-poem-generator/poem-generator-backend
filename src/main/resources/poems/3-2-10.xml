<title>For M.C.</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>The sound that it pored over probed this body
Tension
The signal it implored explored that self
Intention
Plasma poured across the universe
No blame
The cathode star implied another verse
A poled environment
The words explode implode. Presolar diamond. Innocent.</text>
