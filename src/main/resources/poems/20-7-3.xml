<text>Luther flung an ink pot at the devil;
A boatload of Jesuits hit Canton.
Always throwing things around.
The Large Electron-Positron Collider at Geneva
Rejigged for smashing hadrons. Do you want
To model the Big Bang or repeat it?
Well, he smiled, the closer we get the better.
Just so we turned our big bang guns on pyrotechnic China
Which met the foreign devils with ink and a wolf's-hair blade.</text>
