<title>Grand Hotel
</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>A 20 dollar room
a 19 dollar call to say
I'm back to piped hot water
optional kick-start air con
and the vagaries of the telephone.

I won't say
the SHELL building by the catwalk
has a big red neon sign with the "S" conked out
that the air would kill a cockroach
that the breakfast garden's bleary and cloaked in soot.

The place is perfect.</text>
