<text>As I was driving down to the video
Shop, with my daughters in the back,
A woman was walking up the street in a black
Dress, cut just above the knee. She was
Honey-brown and beautiful, black
Hair to the neck, black shoes and a
Beige raincoat that didn't really match:
The outfit was underneath. She looked
Ahead, but her expression, while
Rapt, was far from humourless,
As though she knew and accepted that
Her radiance, especially
When she was dressed in black, was such
That cars would suddenly
Drive as if through honey.
