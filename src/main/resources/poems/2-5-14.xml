<title>Banshee
</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>With a gonging blash, the garage door
Gets bashed in by the brash ice.
Gutters blench in water brash. Branches
From the garden banished
Slowly climb
Down their etymology
Past Byzantium
To the feet of beasts,
To the pads and claws of animals.</text>
