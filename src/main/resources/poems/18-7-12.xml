<text>So sumbdy or sumhn's put a mortal hex on me:
I'm going to die and rot. No, a mortal sex.
We play this game wi the grunts: what's under the figleaf?
Another onky! - A whit? - One o thae buttonholes
To go wi the two wee buttons on yr chist.
No, it's this! They looked. They were fucking helpless.
Then here's this wanker wi a flaming sword
Saying  Get thee hence! - I says what? Get thee sense?
But what can y dae? Whack him wi yr rubber truncheon?
