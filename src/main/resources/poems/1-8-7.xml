<title>Imperial Measure
</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>An eighth of an inch, of an hour, of a ton
Of a note, of a beat, a beatitude,
Woe to you, cardinal. Ordinal - 8th,
A catch in the breath. Is it
Octaves or tens? D'you count thumbs,
Sir Augustus, or months (October's the tenth)
A catch in the breath
Half a stitch, a caesura.</text>
