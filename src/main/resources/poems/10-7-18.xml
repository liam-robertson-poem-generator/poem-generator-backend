<title>For Mrs Avery

<text>A dell, a warm
Dimple in the blanket
The cat just stretched and rose from
Nape of the breaker, just that
Neither here nor there, and Spring
The start - again! The start
Again! Until it take on something approaching sense
I wouldn't want to go away
I wouldn't want it to end at all.</text>
