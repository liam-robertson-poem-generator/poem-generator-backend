<text>Is the increasing coldness and complexity of what is
A good? We thrive so close to absolute zero.
All that ancient heat to etch our pattern on a jar
For one reader or none (is there a difference?)
An old clinker on the river nosed ahead: we'd won
Or lost. And that harmonic node on the standing wave along our hull
Subsided.
