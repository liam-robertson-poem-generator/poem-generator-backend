<text>Campbell fancies Marshall something
Rotten. She laughs herself. Forgets to click
The seatbelt when he calls to fob off dinner.
The geomantic junta sees him as young and dangerous,
Bless 'em. She doesn't see the police car till she
Stops on a green light, then wonders (him
Singing the praises of his wife and son)
What this will cost her.</text>
