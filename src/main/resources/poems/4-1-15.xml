<title>The Moon in Crookston, 1976
</title>

<text>Cauldron moon
Sunk in the fog
The Blackamoor dead
And Desdemona
The bastard and the liar and
The fool: tales told
On a cog of flowers
On a once wise head.

A blasted heath
A tree and a king
No crown. He watches arise,
Above the rook, a bloody,
Lunatick, infant head.</text>
