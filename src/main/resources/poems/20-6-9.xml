<text>A lilt of swell to lift it clear
Caulked with lint and liniment
If you licked a stamp and stuck it to the hull
Would they deliver?
What system linked and storm uncoupled
Took more than a boat to buckle as it limped
Water lipped the deck and lisped in spray.
Light poured out the sky.
With a moderate list to port, by night it lit
The feeble flare of the wake.
