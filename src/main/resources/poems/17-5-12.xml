<title>A Self-Educated Working Man
</title>

<text>One claps them in clay or casts in bronze
The calfs and bulls, the calves and bellies.
Cramps in the hand and cracks in stuff
It's a tough life, a good one.

Another clasps a scrag of - what? - existence?
Clamps it to him, cranks the ratchet till
This cracks and shears off.
He calques it to a noise, and that's its sense.

A pack of those and he's the priest or bard
The cat's pyjamas. Camps on the holy mountain
Caps the warrior with gold. His agent
Carts off the silver. So the castes divvy up

What paddies grew. The karsts gang dry
And they forget to wreak, descry, defend.
The sense of class comes down to the crass
Estate of connoisseurship.</text>
