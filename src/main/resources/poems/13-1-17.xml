<text>See the red berry in the beak of the bird
And the streak of seed and birdshit.
The guttered sun passes through the night
To reflection on the slate kerbstone in the light.
All the nightclouds I hear
And the dreams I forget
And the sunny evenings
Then the dewfall and the wet
Grass. I guess
At paths through the tumble
Of the cumulus.
There's a tract in the grasses and gravel digests
All but the conscious. Only in dreams
Can the notions pass
Through my grounds and grow
From the night, where now
They have to go.
Shook off from the sea, there's a city
Roars and greets in the drains of its sleep.
All the breadcrumbs in the black grass,
But there's no birds.
Asleep on the breathing cornices.
The starlings are asleep.
