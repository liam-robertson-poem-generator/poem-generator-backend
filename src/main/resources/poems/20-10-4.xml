<text>The waitress - she looked fierce and sounded Polish.
Menu, chalked on a board behind her head,
Long as the queue behind me. To save time
I said 'what do you have for breakfast?' she said
'What did I have for breakfast!?!?' - 'no, wait
A lime soda, to go.' What would I get?
A lindenflower ptisane? A
Bicarbonate and lunar caustic shake?
See Brexit? I don't know about you
