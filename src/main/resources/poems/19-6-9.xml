<text>I wished, but not for her,
Though when I woke on the topmost bunk
She was still asleep below, and dreamt of musk.
In the 3rd-class wagon others wept and sang.
A star winked out
The meniscus winced
As a pail, winched up,
Unstuck the surface. Whit?
The cream o' the well?
Not as in whipped or whisked.
I wished I knew and, sudden, did
Too much: set out like a hand o whist
The braird and wilt of the brilliant
Ineffectual wit.
