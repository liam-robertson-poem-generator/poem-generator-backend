<text>When you wade it slows you down, but if you let go,
It weighed and bore you up, it bore you out, refulgent,
Justified in what you'd willed and waled.
Investors in the sabbath wailed anathema;
You smiled and waved, for God
Had waived his right to kamikaze,
Avenging wind. Not that his might, in any way, had waned
Or dwindled.</text>
