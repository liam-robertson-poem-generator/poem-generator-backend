<title>Diaz (for Pietro Cardines)

<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>The Colonel's face was usually set to say "bosh";
When he came to the kirk,
"The married man lives like a dog",
He said to the groom, "And dies like a king;
For bachelors, it's the other way round."

So this year the General wed
A shipbuilder's widow and wastrel son
And they didn't want him for his wit
As he had the wit to see, too late,
And die, this day, like a dog.</text>
