<text>HIS boss calls me in to say
I'm not getting the boss's job
That I didn't ask for and don't want
So why am I disappointed?
Parked there like a stiff in a skiff.
Like, my doctor calls to tell me
Eh, you haven't got the syph.
So what HAVE I got? Ah, him:
Too specialised (here, have a snif-
Ter o this. OK, when I'm done with this spliff)
Too many languages, too much professional
Sylph. What? sylph or salamander.
You're away wi it. May be.
