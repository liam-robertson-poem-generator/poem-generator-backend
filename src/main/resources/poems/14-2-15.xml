<title>The Winning Side</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>The kiloton roar from Hampden Park
Exults in a hundred and fifty thousand throats
In-off Mount Florida
To Battlefield, Queenspark and Pollok grounds
It surfs the Mosspark sycamores and hedges
Subsiding in Cardonald
Twenty-odd seconds after the event.
