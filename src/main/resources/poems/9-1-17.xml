<title>Daphne and Apollo
</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Buonaparte got from his brother-in-law
A Louvre load of statuary.
Who was it took my daughters' shades and adolescent finery?
- the cameras, CD players, music, phone, passports and holiday cash,
The Dante, Milton, Joyce;
Two weeks pay at least gone down
With shares in children's memories
While we were in the Villa Borghese
As the god caught up with her
And the look on their face as the lymph in her took hold
And the laurel tree consumed her
And Napoleon's sister sat next door.</text>
