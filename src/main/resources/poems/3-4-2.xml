<text>Breakfast is the best meal
Sunday breakfast after mass
The full cholesterol deal. The extended
Family, at least three of them
Stricken with angina
(Never saw the inside of a pub).
My personal best is three: at the hotel,
In flight and then home. Don't clear away
The breadboard and the jampots; never know,
My paints and palette, as Renoir might have said
If you don't need to paint like you need
Your breakfast, then don't.
