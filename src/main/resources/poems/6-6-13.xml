<title>Lunch with the FT</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>You filch the entrance code
To the tabernacle fridge
Push back the fringe and tassels
Pull down on the car-door handle
And there's Henry enthroned
In a cloud, a brittle
Flitch of meat in his mitt.
'It's better than sex', he says.
