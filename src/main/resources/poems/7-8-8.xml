<title>To Ozymandias at the OK Corral
</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Hail, Thane of the Azores,
Hail, King of Poland,
About to be the Caliph of Baghdad!

Mother of all bombs
Pray for us
Pillar of salt
Pray for us
Political science
Do what you want
Hail to the Chief
Bomb us
Shock and awe
Vote for us

I and fifteen nations that prefer to remain anonymous
Support you in whatever it is you do.</text>
