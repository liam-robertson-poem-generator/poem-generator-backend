<title>Mission Control</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Amice, alb and girdle, stole and chasuble
The priest got togged up like an astronaut
To blast off in a cloud of incense
Orbit the altar two-and-a-half times
Do some moonwalk maintenance on the tabernacle nose-cone
Then back to the chapel house
For Sunday lunch.
