<text>Boys in the morning
Pluck fish from the reef:
The puzzling crow
Scoops at itself in the only glass
Window. I read and I cook
And I read. Biarritz, '41:
A cocktail reception so
Brilliant, who needed the view?
And who was that flyting with
Good Walter Benjamin? Who
Could outshine Django Reinhardt?
To the host I said tell me, how many survive?
He smiled and he said two or three. Head down,
Kneel down on that carpet and scream
To wake here, in Bata'an. What connection?
Same surf, the same transient swallows;
Perhaps the same quiet American found himself
Here one year on, being marched to his death by the Japs.
And I saw Biarritz as a child, when American
Bombers were using Bata'an to undo Indochina.
No need for ordnance now, the planes are enough.
Just two degrees more and you're gone from the reef to the road.
