<title>Hamartia

<text>Ham in his hammock
Next to Noah.
"What's a hamadryad, dad?"
"No-one opens that crate:
Not now, not never!"

What would you have done?

The snake escaped to India,
The ape regressed to the Great Rift Valley.
She, when they cut the tree down,
She died. It's as simple as this:
No harm, no harmony.</text>
