<title>Rehab of Shakespeare</title>

<text>Piano tones ... begin loud and bright
and then decay to silence in a complex way
that's characteristic of the instrument.
- Robert Moog, Byte 6, 1986
Marrying clearest word to soundest verse
And five reiterations of the burden
Rowed in fire and stone (like a pharaoh's curse),
Intoned to last until the final Amen;
And we can't make head nor tail of who the song's
Regaling with its DECUS ET TUTAMEN.
Our end is nigh indeed if verse among
Stunned sinners is recalled when doom is clapping;
Absorb and sift, time, shift all that we've done,
Remit, maybe, a broken seal, Harappan
Inscription pan -ar ki(r), "the singer's mark",
A thunderstone. Love doesn't fear the dark.</text>
