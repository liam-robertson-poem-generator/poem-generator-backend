<title>Eating the British (for Paul Muldoon)</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Into the blanket he stitches his sores
Costume carbuncles and garnets.
His face is all craters and sockets.
It snows as he snores in his quilt, he's the man in the moon
Who stows his feet under the headrest in front of him.
Who sows the disease soars on fomite forty-one degrees.
The outside air temperature fifty below.
I don't think he's well, you know.
This fever slows the sowers, boot soles stuck in the
Tarry floor of heaven, all chewing gum and silly spores,
Which roofs the random, psychotic settling of scores.
A chaplain scolds the braves that eat the British,
One of whom stoves his head in as he strolls to the chapel house.
The frequent flier scrolls down. Sticks and stones.</text>
