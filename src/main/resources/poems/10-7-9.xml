<text>My debt is the life I have left, and I'm paying ;
I've been dealt a fine hand I can barely hold to my chest.
Oh, if I could put a dent in this wall of law, now that would be something,
But duty and debt accrue. Forget forgiveness
Deft as the hands of a servant when she tucks in linen.
Dressed in ancient clothing, decked in pearls stronger than the law
She dreamt on sleeping waters and the dream
Forgave
Forgetfulness.</text>
