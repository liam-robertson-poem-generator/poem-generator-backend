<title>'Tishe vody, nizhe travy' (Blok)</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Took the Scottish highers
Like a deer fence, its
Invigilated hush. The herd
Hides in its numbers. Can't see
The wood for marts and hinds,
For venison and methane.
It swarms on ruin,
Hives and shingles of rugous bark,
Verbal contract hires
For trivial hits and highs.
