<text>O Sole Mio plus zen equals fado
Nostalgia borne as vanity so grand
A package tourist might not miss it.
Fad for bread and olives, bacalao
In Jesuits contending for Japan.
The Fang had just moved in when they
Flagged Angola from the coast, the Portingales
Farmed as a last resort, wrote out
Pessoa, sang Lucilia do Carmo.</text>
