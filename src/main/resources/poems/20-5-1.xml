<title>In the Royal Palace at Luang Prabang

<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Sitting for Ilya  Glazunov in 1967
The Queen of Lao has asked and answered the question
How many divisions does he have?

Was it she who was to die in a cave?
The new Lao royal ballerinas
Smile and demonstrate the safety procedures

To which an ancient singer
Keens an older coronach, and slips away,
Unmarked.</text>
