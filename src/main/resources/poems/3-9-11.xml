<title>If It Please Your Honour</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Guilty pleas are easy
But when a man pleads not guilty
The counsel for the prosecution preens:
It's story time.
Can the accused deny that every Wednesday in Lent
He pees in the soup to peals of mirth from his delinquent peers?
The defendant can and does:
The peas in the soup are as in fog
Where evidence is murky
Where even silks are sulky.
He peels his cataracted lenses and peers in.
