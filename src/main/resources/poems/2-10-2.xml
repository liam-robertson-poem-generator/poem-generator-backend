	<text>What constitutes a bribe? Any gift with a shadow,
Any service with a smile. If you want to bribe me
Don't be subtle. Here's the list:
That desk lamp like the Stobcross Crane, on Boulevard Montparnasse,
1600 francs. Dostoevsky's complete, 3000 francs;
A 16th century Russian Anastasis, the size of a paperback,
That was 25,000 francs in 1985.
A Borsalino panama hat, an old cinquecento;
A covered swimming pool, duly maintained;
That job with airline tickets to romantic places;
The removal of those who offend me, bringing back the ones I miss;
Reincarnation as Genji, till I get bored;
Rebirth as the Buddha until everyone gets a life and there are no bribes.</text>
