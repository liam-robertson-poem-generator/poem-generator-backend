<title>"Buenos Aires: Ex-dictator on child-abduction charges"
</title>

<text>Three drops of rain on my back
As I was throwing out the children's cot
The playpen and the bags of clothes.
"Zero to six" it said, meaning months:
Years back then were unthinkable.

Three drops of rain on my back
From the storm on a campsite over the mountain
Connections we make, quick as thinking - Now
Twenty years after abduction at birth
Of babies from blindfolded prisoners

Three drops of rain on my back. I was tortured
With my little failure to love
While people like me were being dumped in the Atlantic
In case they upset the account I'm paid from -
This globe. Good old Henry Kissinger.</text>
