<text>This might have been my favourite port for waiting out monsoons
In lamplight, behind bead curtains
But holiness cut a strath through local life:
Women took cover and men to the pulpit.
The singer who mocked their pat exegesis
Of mudslid muezzins and rubbled kirks -
Well you know what happened to him.
Five centuries on, some archive explorer
Will crack a wry smile.</text>
