<text>The Book of Kells - all special effects
And empty faces. Calligraphers
Should keep to the kerbs with their skateboard tricks,
Their doodles to the margin. Instead of
Ordering kegs of cochineal klegs from the ancient east,
They might have learned how art
That kens and quells distraction
Can engineer this confrontation.</text>
