<text>That Octopus vulgaris, precooked,
Presenting its little hole to me
In a chuckable plastic monstrance
Should mimic a succulent cactus -
Something a zombie might
Tuck behind its ear - is not what got to me
But the fact that one, on a sinecure
In San Diego Zoo, escaped at night
To dine on rare crabs in a neighbouring tank
And then snuck back.
