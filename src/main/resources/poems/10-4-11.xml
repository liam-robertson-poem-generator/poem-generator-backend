<text>Dumb's the word
In winter duds
That duns darkling streets for sense
Oysters on crushed ice, chestnuts on coals,
Wally dugs jitterbug on hearths as lorries pass.
Fun drugs for some, prescription for all,
But tons of it: neurochemical talking drums
Whose dull word drubs dissent.
This market is real and the war is screen-deep, dumbskull.
You want that reversed? It overdubs your exospeak
Till we're doves on a wire at Tahir Square, a little christmas
Bow on our beaks: a doo does what a doo does. Sing:
A doo does what a doo does.</text>
