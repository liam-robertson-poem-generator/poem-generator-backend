<text>The herder had hardly got his ox to lumber along the path
Till its shoulders surge as sea-swell, bristling auks and guillemots;
So much for zen. He bobs along with the compass-orts for oars.
Dick Tracy was drawn to look like John Wayne, not a razorbill;
So much for comics. He stops his options and subscriptions.
The world is control, psy-ops and samsara. He offs it.
So much for that.
