<title>Ape

<text>I'd just come back from Kivu
Where I'd seen gorillas
When I took my family to Basel zoo.
There was something I wanted to check
For a poem I was writing.
A steady flow of people, a glass, a primate household
Who'd seen all the humans and knew all the food.
When I moved up to the glass
A young one dropped what it was doing
And ran across to watch my face.
Such a calm and amber-ancient gaze
I'd never known, and
Couldn't hold. I smirked and chattered.
It was me that let go
And one of us sank.</text>
