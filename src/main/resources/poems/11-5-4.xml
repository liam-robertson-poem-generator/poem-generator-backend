<text>If you're not there, I'm all alone
If you don't care, it doesn't count :
The scam in the system.
I made this up myself, at least. I didn't lift it
From some piece of smarm to Ra.
If I'm the slam in slammer, not
The son in prison, tell me. I'll stop.
I swam in the sea today. It wasn't bad
At all. I was fairly nervous, like now.
Nothing like the ugly, panic cancer..
Death doesn't worry me, cruelty does. You got that ?
Amen.</text>
