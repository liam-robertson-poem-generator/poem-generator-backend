<text>He liked to feed the birds, Mad Uncle Joe,
But this was a midget basking shark on wings,
Salty wings; its eye - the sun as seen from Jupiter.
And it wowfed the lot. So he puts away his trowel
(he'd just bricked up his bedroom fireplace) and he says right.
He gets his  gun (he had a gun) (he was a hopeless shot)
Watched it fly to his roof and when it alighted, bang. No gull.
No blood and feathers either. They reckon it had had a heart attack.
Anyway. It fell right down his bedroom chimney.
