<title>Cob
</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>A dusty red and rusty
Dead 1930s Norton
In the cellar
By the wine butt
Next to me.

A motor pump to draw ad lib
On an old artesian well.

A Bluebottle throttles down on cobweb roads.

Kob was the one I picked on
When the others picked on me.
He was timid; I was the pariah
Collaborator clobbered in the pecking order
Egged on by a chicken-necked solicitor.

I didn't have much physical skill or
The toughness to match my temper
(Which I still have trouble mastering).
It's still a football match
With neither goal nor referee.</text>
