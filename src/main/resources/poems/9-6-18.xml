<title>Vengeance is Mine
</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Tirl the lock. Now pummel the door.
There's a lull in the killing. This is war.
Empty the till. Stop the push of the drawer
With your pubis. Pocket the notes.
House-to-house searches grundle and twirl,
Crash through the living-room wall.
Till the old town with an Abrams plow;
Scatter contempt and it grows.
Here are the dudes in their cavalry twill:
The supply lines have finally caught up.
Till later, we barter.
Bombs are in dollars, buildings in blood.
Warble and trill, little bird. In the garden
Later, bury your voice.</text>
