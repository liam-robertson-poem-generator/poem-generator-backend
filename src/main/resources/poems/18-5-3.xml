<text>- which accounts for the	Hup!
Which accounts for the 	Hip-hop!
Accounts for the harp on the gunwale
Which accounts for the hoop on the funnel
Which accounts for the heap for the hope for the 	Help!
For the hype about Cromwell and Rommel
Which accounts for the hemp on the criminal
Which accounts for the hump on the camel
And the orthodontic hasp on the sphinx's
Eroded, inscrutable smile.</text>
