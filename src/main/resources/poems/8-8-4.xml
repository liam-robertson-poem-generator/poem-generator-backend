<title>Counterpoint

<text>Flying to Cambodia
Hearing - of all pundits - him
Deplore the outrage
I see the Angkor State
Crowned by four colossal TV screens set back to back,
The head of Henry the K is beaming out of every one.
He must recite
The myriad name of the unknown victim
Till he get it right. K331,
Piano variations. Cabin crew</text>
