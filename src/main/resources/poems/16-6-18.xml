<title>Girl</title>

<text>You skip this vowel and syllable
And the word's mock-friendly cuddle.
With an alto growl and a Scotch snap
You're gone. I'm back
To pronouncing my own name
That some hear as McCaley
And verbal algebra, in which
The gill of a shark becomes
The air-vent grill of a racing car.
