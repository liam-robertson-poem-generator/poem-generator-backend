<title>Apollo Belvedere / Attendant</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Lob
The sun high
And a narrow arch
Beyond which
As in a pond
She watches
Apollo Belvedere
His bow and laurel sprig.
A face glimpsed in a crowd
Can get Bernini'd in me
Figured like Chipangu
By cartographers to the pope.
Clear brow, and from the bridge
A steep, narrow ridge down
To two commas.
Straight, retentive mouth and eyes.
There
Is a face
That may become
A map on vellum and bone
Of forgotten countries.
