<text>You'd lent me your apartment
I was looking out the window on New York
And put my hands
In the pockets of your trenchcoat
Which I had no right to do, even if
It did look like my daughter's.
I found a brown velvet clasp with a loop of ribbon
You fastened back your hair with that.
There was a singlet of yours on the floor.
In the other pocket
Was a wrapper from an Opal Fruit. This WAS
My daughter's coat. What am I doing here?
Wisely then I woke up.</text>
