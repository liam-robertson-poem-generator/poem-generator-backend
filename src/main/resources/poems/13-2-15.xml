<title>Adolesce

<text>As we got to the first floor landing I asked you out.
You smiled and said no, you had to meet your cousin.
I was glad you had a cousin. I was glad grey light
had moored the banister.
Tenements were sandstone, that I knew,
but I wondered what stone the steps were -
grey as light, worn as driftwood beams,
as lips or shinbones I could have kissed,
like the lintel of a shore temple,
caressed and corroded by winds and visitors.</text>
