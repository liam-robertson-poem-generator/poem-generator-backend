<title>Aengus, Again (for Marina Ramsay)</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>I wander till I'm wandert
And she's a freckled shadow mapped
On a pool, and won't be guddled, much less
Cuddled, hazel glimmering. Rapt,
These fifty years, in her and on her,
Played, till time and tides peg out,
A cold contusion of the moon,
A gold ring flung to catch a trout.
