<text>That skulk-in-the-grass with the rattling neck
Would up and crack my nose with its skelfy haft.
My nose! Next it's inscribing isobars
In gravel courts where they rake in oxblood leaves
That the monsoon squanders.
'I would like to spend two months', says Beckett,
'In the country, digging holes,
Filling up each one as I go
With the earth from the next'.
