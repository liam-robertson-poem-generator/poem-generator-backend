<text>Such are the rooms I haunt, the rows
I've caused in empty houses. Rounds
Of drunken talk unwind. It's hard
To rouse a man from that. And yet
She did, with ruse and reason. Well,
Some ruins you abandon. Certain
Runes are left unsaid. The rules I broke?
It was them or me. You might say
He rues the day.
