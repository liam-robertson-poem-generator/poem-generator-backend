<text>Light helmet, bowed back, high-
Viz bodice, wasp waist (of course)
Fleeing along at head height
And my bike
So titanium light you can't see it.
Just keep out my way.
There's a theory
Bikes devour time
A matrix, the cyclists at rest there
Happy as larry, flouting the rules
Of the road and the maxims of physics.
