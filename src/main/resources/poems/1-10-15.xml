<title>Goodnight, Irene
</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Irene, I dreamt of you again last night.
No need to tell you. You told me
Unless we stayed together I would not see you again.
Your tongue is salty, pacific. We grappled
In the alcoves on the street but never quite
Sand in my saliva when I woke, sand in my pockets.
Shells in the bathroom marked  "Made in Formosa,
Ireland" the wintering of anger
Lazybeds of semtex please
Do not disturb the sleep of Roman
Reason with the gods Irene, Irene.
Iris, rainbow, messenger of the Greek
Gods, I see you gold and brown and black.
Why? Have I lost the farther colours?
Or are you the message now? Tell her,
Tell Irene, tell her anything, from me.</text>
