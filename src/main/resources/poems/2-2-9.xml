<title>Toad in a Thunderstorm</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Some kind of bloat-fish shat and boaked itself
Up to the eyes in nothing to boast about;
Tremulous self-possession broached by thunder
Tries to bolt but, rather than lollop, totters, a pantomime fart:
Bad legs of two old men in high heels,
An upturned boat on top.
