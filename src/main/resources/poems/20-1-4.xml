<title>Loom
</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>A red-throated diver, the jut of its jaw.
I'm weaving the waters in this old tub.
The shafts rise on the rowlocks
As I pull the oars to my bollocks.
Land ahoy, like a whiff of smoked egg plant.
Saint Brendan! With an heirloom like this,
Do you reckon it's landfall tonight?</text>
