<title>Commute

<text>The beasts! The foul
Ignorant
Beasts of the field. Mild
Breists. The print
Of beefs and hams
On grass. Beliefs,
Not for ruminants, soothe
Eaters of meats
Obese in their briefs,
Two beats to the bar.
But a goat goes in for
Rooty beets and frosty grasses;
It bleats
As greens kellogulate
And mists
Turn over and go back to bleeps
Alarm beeps sleep
Snore the broker
Lost his breeks
And doesn't know
Nothing but chickens have beaks.</text>
