<title>On a trouv√© mon corps dans le corps de ma m&#232;re - Carla Demierre</title>

<text>My body was found in my mother's. Same pink
The same face more or less the same tripe
And intestinal flora I guess maybe blood type.
No womb for the next just a plug for some socket
I shrugged her off like an old shirt.
