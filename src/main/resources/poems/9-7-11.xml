<text>Words - a wad of tens for tramps
Inflation tends to sully.
The joker treads a line between
Two towers on a bar chart made of trends
In sub-prime loans for real estate that was.

Terns bob around him, spears trained on runkled water
The architectural paradigm comes to terms with -
Which tells us something about endeavour in the abstract,
Where twelves, for instance, is a word, and twelve a number.</text>
