<title>Counsel to Foreign Poets</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>If you want sex, better write in English
And it has to make sense, but not too much.
If you're one of those serfs still ploughing regular verses
It's an EU farming subsidy you want. So - 
Option 1. Forget it. English poetry is a WOFT.
Option 2 is septs and sects and celts and kilts and cults. They love it.
Option 3. Now this one's only for well connected zeks:
Get somebody to translate, footnote and print your every fart.
Option 4. Encrypt. And then encrypt the key.
Conceal the stents and shunts, the technical specs.
Option 5. For dollars cash and foreign scents, you get
Constraints retailed as strengths
(now there's a word, eight consonants, one vowel)
supple grammar and institutional lock-down
that generate immeasurable stress. Do not engage.
Play chases, type faces, make empty sets of noises
A flight of steps going back the way it came.
