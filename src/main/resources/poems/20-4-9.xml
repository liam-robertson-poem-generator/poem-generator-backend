<text>Lust wasn't him. He'd never
Lurked in puissant shades
But just lucked out, you know?
Could call it providence.
Lunched with a visiting big man,
Lurched enthusiastically.
Lumped together with ships of state
In diplomatic channels he luffed
And tacked. Tact, yes, that was him,
A touch of vanity.
