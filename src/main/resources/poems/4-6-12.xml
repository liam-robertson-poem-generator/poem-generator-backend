<text>Buy your Bombay mix with rupees
From the Mumbai mint.
Beware of those moustachioed
Greek demigods from Gandahar,
But script their myths of solitude
For Bollywood. Don't miss a trick, so
Little Miss Minx can mince in her minks
A Bangalore rhythm in workaday pinks,
Rings on her mitts, polo mints on her toes,
Steak mince and tatties wherever she goes.</text>
