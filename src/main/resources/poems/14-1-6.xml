<title>Rain</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Cats and dogs in Frosolone
pad about unheard.
Thunder, like the odd stone falling
from another roof.
The perennial rain of the rosary
makes its mark on the old women.
Ruts and runnels in chalk vennels
with water that falls again to shape
fantastic caves in the dark.</text>
