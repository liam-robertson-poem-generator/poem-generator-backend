<text>First it's a pole for shinning up and down
With notches
Then flat steps slotted in slanting round:
It's a proper newel, not for long; 
Each fan treat soon includes its slice of the cylinder
The newel's then a structured space in a helical flight
The binned nowel of an inside mould,
Its message so carefully erased.
