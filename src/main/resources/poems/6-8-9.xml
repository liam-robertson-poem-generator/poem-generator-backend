<text>You were faint, no, slight,
Shoal in a fall of silk
When I opened a book in the loft
Pixels flaked and reconvened
You were fate, crocheted from nothing, no
You're not. That smile in the mirror
Isn't faked. A defensive feint.
Protect, since I'm not there to,
The freight, the value of your moment.
