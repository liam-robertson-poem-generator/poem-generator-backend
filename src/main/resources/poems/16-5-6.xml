<text>Graf Morgen, Clermont, Sunday,
Plots against us.
Not like the officers of night
Who hold as robbers heights they got as sycophants.
Yet will he station coffee cup and croissant
Like chessmen
And smile at the telling gaffe.
He won't give up
Till we gaff him. He holds
The sun should ever rise. But past the zenith -
Into what? Plot a graph, Count: see it dwine.
His Excellency, not unlike Catania,
Rebuilt from what erased it
Time and again.</text>
