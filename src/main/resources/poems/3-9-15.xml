<text>That slightly concave dip to the slope
Of the boardwalk from the platform to the pier
At Wemyss Bay, a gentle gravitational
Send-off on your holidays, its orientalist
Architecture up in smoke, a gentle push
In the swingpark from your faither, now your peer.
Mibbe the piles of the wharf survived
In brine. Buy an old ruin, rebuild it
And use them as beams in the keep. On the firth
Peer out from a turret.
