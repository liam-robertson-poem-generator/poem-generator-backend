<text>Sex is mental
Mostly. Sperm's
Pyjama papier mâché
Smells. The stalks
And stems are blatant,
But cells? Your
Self-fulfilling spells?
What swerves and swells
Like that is meant
Who says? - Is meant 
To be - not necessarily
Calfskin suedes or scrimshawed
Whalebone sleds. But it
Serves and orders, sells time
For something.
