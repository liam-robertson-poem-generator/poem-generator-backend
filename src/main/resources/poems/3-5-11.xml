<text>I saw a snow leopard once.
In Basel Zoo.
Hadn't thought they were real.
It, being four days old, was just a joy.
Now down to pards and ounces in the margin
Unless ... Unless? What kind of word is that?
Shouldn't it mean more? Or nevertheless?
Or a Beckett bedroom farce? He palms a number
Pads along the hall. A keyhole watches her unless
Parse that! But what? Pramfuls of props. Correction:
Pramsful. Two old pals swap pangs in the back.
Unsanctioned, unaccounted for,
The dead, I'm thinking, might have had their plans,
Their secret hopes. But what pans out.
