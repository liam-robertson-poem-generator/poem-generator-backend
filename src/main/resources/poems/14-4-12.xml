<text>Talking heads in ruffs. The codpiece,
Lycra rumps and sackbutt solos.

Rhyme that still could jilt rational ruts
Though its rhetoric rusts in drizzle.

Rough's the word as out her pram
The queen shies chewed-up rusks and toys.

Rucks of her police with orders
Cleave the groundling runts, stage left,

To cut the nose off Mucky-Muck
And Mrs Mucky-Muck as well. Why not?</text>
