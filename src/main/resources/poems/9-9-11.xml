<text>'The tweed's the thing'
Says Polonius. His baby
(He picks a three wood)
Teethes on his lapel.
Oot owre the rough he tees off
Into the trees
That promptly march on Dunsinane
Across the fairway. Cut!
To teas and ices for shiftless teens.
Alone they tweeze expression
Tease out sophistication for the rout,
For dual teams and peer review
Then it's rain that teems Leyland Atlantean windows
In pinball surface tension, butting through
The tears of things.
