<title>Die the Death
</title>

<text>"With the delegates sat there like a choir of jam jars
he dropped this ring in my hand without a glance
as he got up and walked towards their captain
saying maybe we could talk this out. And that, of course,
was the last of him till he turned up in the market
under the butcher's stall. I believe the ring's for you."
	Or:
Took two in the gut at a time and place in town
where even strays would have had ulterior motives.
One journalist maintains it was for lines
on gullets slit for "la francophonie".
The coroner found hookworm. His widow
found grandchildren, but orphaned, and her son
didn't know what to do with the African statues,
cheap copies that they were, in rotten wood.</text>
