<text>In line with my wife
A hen-toed Korean
Not twenty: licorice
Cable of hair at her nape
Down on her temples
No profile. Not quite. A short
Upper lip. Shy
Tits on a stele from the Cyclades
Broad and thin shoulders like wings. A low voice
Resounding in what? How has she felt
Among big Western blondes? Shown
Their passport, both of them gone
On the same plane to Asia.</text>
