<text>Purveyors by appointment to the Peninsular Opium Boer Great Good and not quite Suez War
The Roslin Glen Gunpowder Mills had a tamped, mephitic rale,
Walls thicker than Roslin Castle, fear of iron implements - 
Even its railway tracks were wooden:
Banisters, toppled Scots pine, the ripped-out
Rail from Roslin Chapel.
Dray horses must have been slipper-shod,
Unless they were wooden too:
Rocked by orphans cranking up some great, Midlothian
Concatenation of silent carousels.
Spring: the water rail paddles by;
It grunts and growls and rasps.
