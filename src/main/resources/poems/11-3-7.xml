<title>Sloth</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Well if on the wheel of life you all get
Hammocked on the rim
Of course you wake up fiddling. Just try
Shut-eye when you're hugging one of the spokes.
And who shall we say invented that device?
The green-eyed greed, the two-toed wrath.</text>
