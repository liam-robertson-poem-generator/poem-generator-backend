<text>Eggs are grails - kenspeckle, real,
With miracle yokes and glairs.
The games we play, the clever films we make
Can't measure up, for all Mifune glares
In his samurai kit. Carmichael's
Songs of the Gaels in grains of gold -
Just market gains in augrim winter gales.
Our grades are close to zilch, our colours
Beige and greys. The greys are good.
Wild sheep may safely graze
On pastoral graves, whose brindled glades
Can welcome glums and gays.
Apply the verbal glaze, un-say it.
Gaze till you maybe see.
