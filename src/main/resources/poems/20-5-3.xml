<text>The lamp with its truncated cone of a shade
An updated crinoline lit from within,
The oval of light from it folded at ninety degrees
Where ceiling met wall;
A prussian-blue cat on her lap
Planed off of the dark in the orchard,
Apples no longer kept safe by the drystane
And no longer plucked by the likes of myself
Going home from the library.
She'd be nearing the end
Of her novel, due about now
For return or renewal.
