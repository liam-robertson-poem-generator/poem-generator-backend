<text>She breathed on glass
Wiped every bead and broke it,
Breezed in and beamed at the gawping guests.
The bride was a good breed:
Brood-bearing hips. The groom
Bespoke breeding, all nurture, ill
Nature. Clip that beard and it'll bleed. No,
Really: she sat down to the bleared
And dusty screen to watch alone.
