<text>Jewels and jowls: the opera crowd.
The king of the jews takes a bow. The people choose
Red. Glass. A good blast of Wagner
Tunes up the boxes and tubes. No it doesn't.
A hack in the Interval Bar chews his burgundy.
June's a good month in Bordeaux, see,
For surfing on sand dunes and checking out plonk.
No it's not. The duet's a duel: both want
The soprano. The deal is the tenor
Gets her on stage; the bass gets her off. Yes he does.</text>
