<text>On a whim,
An Al-Khwarezmi,
Augrim, algorism, whim.
No whinchat, stonechat, whin.
This Sunday has been put on once too
Much on that desperate lake;
It's warped and scratched and rainy.
Whip it up and whirl again:
The ducks'll strain their necks and whirr,
The children whizz and whinge, the middle
Air - whistle and whish.
The mountains do their best to
Curtain the whiff of zilch,
But the merest which or whither and not
A whit remains, abandoned hand of whist
On a liner, ice in the sliding whisky glass.
