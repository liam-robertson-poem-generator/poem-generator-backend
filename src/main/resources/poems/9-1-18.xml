<title>In the Bothy</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>One of the pine boards for moulding concrete
Is sawn across, for two supports.
Another piece of shuttering, on the saw bench
Is made to the width of the cabin : table top.
Four three-inch nails whacked in.
The tool, the skill, what comes to hand.
The mason's apron
The trowel towel
Wait a bit:
Could Uncle Starfish be
A magic fluter,
A chip off the old block ?</text>
