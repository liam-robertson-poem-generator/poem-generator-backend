<title>Lost in Translation

<text>He begs her indulgence, she buys him a drink.
Routine goodbyes and then suddenly - nothing
Ever again. It's back to the biles of the self,
The bribes and discourse
Of society: brides and their beaux,
Justice that binds,
Money that blinds us to this.
What bides? "Memories", she'd said.</text>
