<text>Grips the arms and grits his teeth.
The poet with the double sonnet done in glyphs on his skull
(Roussel, of course) is cheating. Guilt's a bitch.
But liquid glints of sunlight, the fine return on gilts,
Gifts of living tendered and withdrawn,
Are too much for him. Drill for the glisks of gold. Trepan.
A shutter glimpse of her ineffable beauty
In camera is uttered.</text>
