	<text>This one's about a poem I haven't written
And have no particular intention to write
Not that I'd read it if I did.
Not that you'd have heard it if I had.
Not so much the square root of a fib as the good cop
Who puts you at your ease by being so reassuringly stupit.
Ease or boredom. Looking for the exit. Rage, aw
Cut to the chase! As in comes knuckleduster Dudley Smith
