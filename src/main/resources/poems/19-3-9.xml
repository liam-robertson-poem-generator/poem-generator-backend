<text>What do we want?
A forty-watt ruby
Big as the wart on this digit.
A waft of chanel from that silk
When I clasp it.
A warped sense of justice
To fit what goes on.
The genie walked down to the lake (he could walk)
Leant on the railing and watched the wee boats.
Anything else? he said, over his shoulder.</text>
