<text>"The fact, discovered by Bowditch,
that the heart muscle, under whatever stimulus,
will contract to the fullest extent or not at all"
  Dorland's Medical Dictionary
There's collarbones like hickory wands,
fine as fanstruts on a soundboard,
patient as wingstruts, fuselage
to vellum stretched on a warping frame.
I could lock you away in this desk drawer
with nothing but the desk drawer key for company.
God knows why I put up with you. God knows
why a woman should take the weight
the aches and murmurs of a husband.
