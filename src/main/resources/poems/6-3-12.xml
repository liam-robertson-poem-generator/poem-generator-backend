<text>This fosse is a mess:
Fops and thugs swapping hats
And half the font's gone to fill teeth.
Flaughts of laughter, great
Gaps in the false fossil record, for this
Is the anthropocene
Year of the Fox,
Which foists on us
Any old ruler - 
King Reynard
Flops on a throne,
Frocks and defrocks
Whoever defaults or de-
Frosts for him
Chicken that he didn't kill.
And business goes on,
Flocks are fleeced and kebabbed.
Floss your teeth, don't forget
Or expect to find love in all this.
The road forks. There's two people,
One does and one doesn't quite
Lie. You've one question.
The woman in white has some
Phlox, as in pH,
A litmus-test posy
Pinned to her lab coat.
Proceed.
