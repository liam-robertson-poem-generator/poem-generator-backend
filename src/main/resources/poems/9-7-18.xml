<title>Sunday Morning Tea in Baghdad

<text>The fate of Lebanon hung by a thread
And that thread was the life of Hafez al Assad.
Last time he went to tell his vote
He was lifted shoulder-high through the crowd
And the television saw him weep. Assad,
Who knew the name of every officer in his army!
Had he forgotten everyone within range was in his pay?
Believe your own lies and you won't see it coming.</text>
