<title>A Viewing</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Winter clothes tucked away in lavender and cloves,
Combs of tortoise shell from coves in the Moluccas,
The bungalow. The business. Yours for a couple of crores.
He cores an apple, but the crows
Or rather rooks (the ones with ice-cream cones for beaks)
Hold out for pukkah carrion: the crones.
Nobody noticed till they'd gone, the giggly clones.
One that codes with knitting needles,
One like vitamin C to common colds, and one
Who'd close the shutters
And smoor the coals.
