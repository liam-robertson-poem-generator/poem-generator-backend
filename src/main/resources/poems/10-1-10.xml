<text>He downed his drink and vice versa,
Each in the other drowned. To be precise
The halt was doomed the day they scrapped the rails
And made the bar he drowsed at from the ties
On whose creosote he drooled. Vats from the same
Were coopered to store the hooch, which did for that
And not just that old dude.
