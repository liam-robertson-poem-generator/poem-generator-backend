<text>What was it, in the tax inspector's water tanks and coolers
Put some bunch of twats through a chemical trance
In the office car park. Under motor-scooter tarps
They quake: The tramps are after us! The ones we never subsidized!
Now what can we do with pocketsful of rodent traps and tin tacks?
Security checks the taps; it tamps
Tamps the evidence into powder
Tracks along the corridor. Of all the thankless tasks
Detective work, I tell you: it's a tart's job that a tart can't do.
