<title>Analog Consumption
</title>

<text>We're lined up on the Dunlopillo foam
Mattress quaffing 'Ola Foam
The fourteen-pound enamelled iron shell
Of the projector splinters memory:
Air and water and light beaten stiff
Instead of featherdown, milk and thinking back.
Dad bought it. The motor caught
And celluloid bubbled up bacillus
On a sputum smear.</text>
