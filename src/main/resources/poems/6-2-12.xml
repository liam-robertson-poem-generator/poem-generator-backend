<text>Folks, I've become more mortal than I'd like.
First it was milky sweat like my old dad,
Then a putrid gust.
What floats and keeps me
Is cubes of reason. Just cast off
And it's rot and sink, or sink and rot.
Although,
There's a force of heart
To jigger habits,
An earthquake storm to rubble forts.
Ach, Swim a bit. 'Said and done
You're three-fourths salt and water.</text>
