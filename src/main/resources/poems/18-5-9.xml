<text>We're hatched or smothered, hushed or
Hashed out / corrected / right ourselves
For a bit. Unlike
His holy angels in Govan.
'What hast, what dost?'
'No rush to dust, thank you, you fucking factoid.'
'Time you hasped that lip, sirrah.'
'Past time you happed that chiffon thing and fell aff.
Time was Tin Dining Street on high was where
You harped, except on the crib.'
'The heart has its reasons reason
Doesn't know - the hurt has too.'
'Maybe, but it beats me. I've harked
(Or hearkened). No one spoke;
I've hacked your system: nothing there
Worth keeping under my hat.'
