<text>An old Jesuit
A very old skeletal J called Father Gitts
Who saved his breath for the poor folk in the parish
Apparently used to say (I only heard him speak the once)
Superstition was the froth on strong faith.
Tottering up the road with laughter
He pointed at a pneumatic hopper and
Said It looks like a dalek.</text>
