<text>One migrant doesn't constitute a quorum.
You can lead a gypsy
Caravan of camels to the slaughter
But a swallow doesn't guarantee a drink.

A tripwire? Bang goes Terp-
sichore. Things go better with Twerp
The tomcat bound-
ing through the temp-
orarily long grass after that
Flying stamp collection.</text>
