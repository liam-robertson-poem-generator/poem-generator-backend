<text>It could be simple as
Log off in autumn,
Lopped and felled to winter in
Some log ossuary, dry as bone.
But with the stump contriving spring,
Does the rood dream spook branches that spark like beaten nails?
Do I really have to be led an endless shortcut by a child
And the river of death to jump?</text>
