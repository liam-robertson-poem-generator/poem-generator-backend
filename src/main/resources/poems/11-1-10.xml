<title>La Kiuva
</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>You'll have seen old faces scoured till they shone
As apple blossom soured into fruit, oh, every time
I scowled at the tree that stood
Like a pupil who would not get one verb wrong.

No friend of pain, I scowed the deep,
Deep Field that Hubble plummeted ;
If every stound of neural lightning
Coined another bright day out of me,
What would the tannic darkness do ?

Well, a self that gets too fearful can be sloughed ;
I'm snake enough for that. Sound in the dark.
The message in the bottle is the wine.</text>
