<text>To spit and piss in pots and pits
Is something Picts will have got
From Rome with lemon pips and fonts.
Were their pimps and panders competent translators?
Likely so. Madam primps. Her man picks her
A spray of pinks that prinks her bodice. Rome!
The pyx of Holy Writ
Till someone pricks its bubble, transmutes
Its gold to lead
And prints.
