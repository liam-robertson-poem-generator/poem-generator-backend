<text>He knights the horses, pawns his queen
Keeps a castle to himself
Divvies the rest in equal, run-rig ninths,
Waits till the knives and forks are cleared away
Then tells them: nice.
A bishop: - Is that timeshare nights or days?
- What?
	- The square you're keeping: is it white or black?
The king just happens to have a knick-nack
Wedge of gneiss and knifes him. Checkmate.
