<text>The nib flew backwards, fast, a bat
Its wings as daggers flung at the blast of dark
It banked and barrelled, backed up, backed up
I bashed this out on brassed-off keys
That barked and snapped at every serif
Some brat, some bract of a garbage lily
Branched across my window listened in
The binary system blacked and blanked it
Sorry officer this won't happen again.
