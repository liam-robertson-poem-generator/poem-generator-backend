<text>It's not true. The cogs are agley.
Chain slips and crawls on the sprocketset cobs.
Platform clogs and clods in their cords
Clich&#233;s in three chords the quad squad puts up with
And corns, and decimal coins. Coigns of culture.
Lib and Lab lost, it's the Cons taking over
Now. Coils and cloys of weird smoke.
Three wee craws sat upon a waa
Out of the way of the cors and buses
The cols up in Brecon, the claws of the raven
A relative clause to compare and contrast. Afraid to take calls
With wistaria coming at you down the phone line.
The cockerel caws
With no end to reason there's nary a cause.</text>
