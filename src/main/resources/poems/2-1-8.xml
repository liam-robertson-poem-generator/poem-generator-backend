<text>Half stricken
By an office canteen sometime roast
Today re-het and dangerous half-chicken
Chomped without a thought
While reading (I not it) a piece forgot
Before the wiping of the gob. All afternoon
My brains in brown-out, not to mention - as we should - 
The institutional boon of low-cost catering,
The routine thrills and spills of what we take for food.
