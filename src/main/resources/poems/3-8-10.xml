<text>The Church and State that paired them off preyed on them.
Their relics paved the road to Paradise, since privatised.
They left a house, no debt, and goods enough
To stop a travelling-rug on a windy beach â€“ 
Not that they pared things down
Or that worldly clutter pained them; it's just
Most of what we were or did
Paled with the Rothesay suntan
Or got planed and sanded out.
For the sins of the fathers they sought indulgence,
For ours they paid up front:
We prayed together all the time.
And though he was more team sports and she piano,
We played together too.
