<text>When does a system fail? What blights and cures,
What bites then licks is salt and savage.
The taste of blood interrogation might arouse
Smoking out wasps in bruckle bykes in lofts,
Prising millibytes of misintelligence from heads
At camps on the bights of Benin, for example, or Okhotsk.
I've seen city states like racing bikes with mandoline-string spokes
And the rust outrun them.</text>
