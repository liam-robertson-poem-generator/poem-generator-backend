<text>The quays and keels, the creeds and creels.
He clears the deck and break- 
Water. Shipping forecast: that queers
And thwarts an otherwise
Acceptable pitch. The sea fog cleaves
As sea fog does. Its emblem? Rothesay
Italian oyster ice-creams. Ach,
The owner cleans the display again.
The queen's booked in for fish tea. Well
She might, but for the herring gull that keens and splatters
She'd award him the keys to Dunoon.
