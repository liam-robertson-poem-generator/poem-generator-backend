<poem>
<title>You will live, woman</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>That your nerves no longer
Grope for yourself in the ground
Now your parents gently
Loosened your grip on the edge
Here I take back every
Word that was written on you
I undo the consolation,
Stifle the hurt.
I unravel death and history,
They my song.
You're a girl of seventeen.
Your mum and dad open the door to greet you.</text>
