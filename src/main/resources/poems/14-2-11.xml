<text>Cut rose claw
Red robes and hooks
Its spectrum roars
Come into me.
Bees, being brainless,
Dae as they're tellt
And brave the gale-force
Rootless rogues.
A witless hero rolls up, rows
His dinghy where no signal roams,
Where something like Dmitri Shostakovich
Roves the Beaufort scale.
He shouldn't have left the roads. He just
Should never have left the roads.
