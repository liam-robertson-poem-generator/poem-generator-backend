<text>What I took for tachycardia, that first night in the berth, it turned out was not. Good thing: my heart does thump, though not so as my knees tremble, rarely at ninety per minute, and never like that when I'm sleeping. What it was, fifty vertical metres below me and a good hundred aft, was a straight-eight marine engine guzzling three-and-a-quarter tons of bunker fuel per hour, driving the propeller shaft at ninety RPM through the zen garden of the engine room, its formal walkways and footbridges, on through the end of the hull to whatever size of bronze propeller it takes to push a hundred thousand tons of freighter through the ocean at eighteen knots.</text>
