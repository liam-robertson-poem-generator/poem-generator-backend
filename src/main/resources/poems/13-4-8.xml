<title>Ch hanno perduto il ben del intelletto</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>To equate the correcting of lies with censorship
Is the work of a corrupted mind. Anscombe
And Dante both are pitiless
On those who've lost the good of the intellect.
There's one, afraid of me for years, is now emboldened.
A crisis looms: he believes he's a good man -
No smoke no drink no fuck the pretty women he
Recruits to do the dirty while he travels
How he flies on company time! But he wants me dead
And his boss has told him do it.
The crisis of course is mine: shun evil -
I've never felt its deranging effects
Close up before. Nor am I sure this structure
Can both capture and withstand it.</text>
