<text>One steals 50k, gets caught, returns it, gets promoted
Along with the girlfriend, the sycophant, the old pal;
Jobs for votes, jobs for pensioners who know the ropes;
A zombie mafia runs the winsome kids of zombie dads.
Cataracts of management, disconnecting work from pay
And harassment from consequence. Go on, you gawm,
Jump in.
