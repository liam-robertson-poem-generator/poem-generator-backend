<text>Cowglen. The river
Downs it
Drowns it
Drunk and drools
On the drowse of grasses.
The mayfly dhows pools.
Caddis worms in jewel dowels
Stay
The bickering burn.

Doom's a big word.
But the way those alpha dudes ignore
The little dos and don'ts, you wonder
How it can go on,
How long will the druse instruct its geode.</text>
