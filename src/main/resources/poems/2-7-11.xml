<title>Silent night
</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>The berrs were oot for the bells
When Mary Buttn Benz (his face to see)
Cam cruising doon fae the Himalbergs
On hairpins, and shook out her hair:
A squad of Buddhist bonzes hits the flair
And begs a bowl of purritch.
One by one she beds them down
And bends her mind to squaring this
With the Yogi bears.</text>
