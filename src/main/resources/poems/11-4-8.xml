<text>He took the sun and swung it
Round his heid and slung it
Owre the low hills west of Langholm.
What makars did back then! The other stars
Trummelt till his rant was sung to silence.
It might have been meningitis, ken,
His spinal cord high strung at best
And something to stun or astonish his system
Stung him. He'd sprung a leak, spun out of line.
