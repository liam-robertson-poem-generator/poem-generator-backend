<text>Fit your face around
This fist first and then
We'll flirt with questions
Later. Flicked
The sonar switch: he's bats flit flit
Dear doctor inappropriate
Affect fixed again
Like he did last summer
He's flipped again
Like he did last year
O wo wo yea.
Frisked him, fished out
Something he'd filched or sumbdy
What's that then?
Search me.</text>
