<text>The craft that he coxed
The croft where he crashed
Got corked in a bottle with snow.

The sentence was quashed
His warder got coshed by an
Angel. He was free to go.

But the star's mum and dad
Had rocked the wee lad
In a cradle too close to the wall:

They'd tucked him up proper
And clocked him a cracker
Or six in his cot - that's not all:

For Ugh the cat caught
Influenza. It coughed up
The code and then copped it. The bug

Crossed and cropped a wheen species and specimens
Sparing one cocked-up, would-be librarian
Of a race on which nature had just pulled the plug.</text>
