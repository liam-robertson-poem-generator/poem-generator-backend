<title>Sheath Knife
</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>An iron blade in bumper chrome
A green and red tin pommel
And a genuine leather sheath.
How many weeks of The Hotspur
Would he miss for seven and six?
And which of the Ten Commandments
Was it wrapped in? Covet and steal.
"A leaden sword in a golden sheath
A godlesse heart in a goodly body."</text>
