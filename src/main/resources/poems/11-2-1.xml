<text>You are so
Slow
That though my toes are sprouting
Totty roots in cellars of my sleep
I still have time to clip them
(only one needs disinfected) and outrun you.
I could sew a lifer's worth of gunny sacks
As you fumble for the complement to that verb you uttered earlier,
Stow your every breath in subtle verses
And, as you turn towards me and away,
Watch the Arctic ice and snow disperse and recongeal.</text>
