<text>Andid those fee
Tin ancientime
Swalk upon England's mountains green?
To paraphrase: did Jesus Christ bless Britain with his presence
When a friend of the family went on a business trip?
Did the Aramithean tin man do his Virgil down a pit,
Saying "Look lad, this is a vug, no not gehenna, just a gap
In the rock of ages"?	Cornish with its tin;
In the Maronite mass the Punic words of Christ;
With its guns the English language will fall silent.</text>
