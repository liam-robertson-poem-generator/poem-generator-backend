<text>Go littel prick, lyke tae a cordliss moose,
lee aff the gentle furrow
amid the winter bracken o the mons,
an snoove in every burrow
you kin squeeze or rattle roon in.
Mak mair contax
thn a public libury copy say of
Michael Jackson: the buke o the
film o the tune, or Cawse
ma Politan, or Jings, or Peepil's Fren.
Jist mind y pick up less in the way o
viral anecdotage
on the wey. Dust jaicket, eh?
An whin yir back,
forwandirt and forjaisket
wi makin the maukin ding,
an whin ma liver's back fae Burgundy,
my hert fi the Hielans, ma lungs
fae the laundry, and my brains,
my squasshy walnut smergh fi its
pickle-jaur in the oaffice,
we'll mibbe can get thegither
an dae organic barbershop quintets
under ur windy. Mibbe she'll gie us
undeclared employment the odd dinnertime,
munelight when the weanzr it school
and the wee yin asleep in iz pram.</text>
