<text>Hot skin on a hard flame
A string of saxophone
Expletives in a husky voice
Over a buzz that doesn't sting.
It's a swing state, this:
Sing, and it gets parsed
To sin and prayer;
The music - cotton-tempered rhetoric.
Sling woe, my sweet,
And that old kit bag
Out the chariot. Spin me some shellac.
The dishwasher stinks; it must be spring.</text>
