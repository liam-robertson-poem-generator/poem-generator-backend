<title>The Art of Memory

<text>'Two gods are at the door for you.'
I went outside. The agora
Was Buster Keatoned round me : just
Two pillars from that temple
To the horseman and the boxer, twins
This church of Paul is clinging to like faith
Are left : old Menico Scarlatti blacking out
And no score to consult
But a polis file of stolen goods recovered
For Naples has forgotten more
Than what it is to starve, and what it is,
Like the song of songbirds in tiny cages,
That sage or salvia
in pots at kitchen windows
Of hill villages that squat the hanging gardens
Of villas double-parked
Alongside byzantine and gothic crypts
In seismic streets and avenues
Where messengers on vespas
Have lost their cool, their suave, their messages
From Ladislao d'Angio Durazzo, say, to Belisarius,
Secretes, that brings to mind both mint and grapefruit.</text>
