<title>The Tortoise and the Hare
</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>The hare-brain dreamt it had been
Haired, like brained, its hair banged out
And - think "Pandora's toothpaste" - jugged, like
Jammed in a carapace when, hoached and hazed,
It hailed a cab that tottered up on bricks and chocks
To the finish line.</text>
