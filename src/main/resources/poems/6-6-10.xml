<title>Their Favourite Things
</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Clingfilmed Cadillac, shark finned and grinned
With Frigidaire doorhandles.
Ivy-League widows, defrilled and deskilled
Frigged and fulfilled, who fibbed and stayed true
To whisper-fridged kitchens and soft-figged shade
Choc-full of goodies that
Fizzed and frizzed in contact with the heat
They couldn't take.</text>
