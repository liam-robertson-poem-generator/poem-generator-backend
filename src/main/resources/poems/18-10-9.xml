<text>"Norfolk sprung thee, Lambeth holds thee dead
Clere of the County of Cleremont, though hight."
Two trochaic pairs, a hard jolt, then charging dactyls.
Dead names; another heist, another title.
"Hiked up to Scotland, flattened them at Flodden;
What thanks do I get? He lops the boy's heid aff".
The king's man - not your own - that anger
Brought you to the block. Your prosody
Won past it. High office, much hyped,
Is nothing without the depth
(Wide though you were)
To make it work. To stop the king.</text>
