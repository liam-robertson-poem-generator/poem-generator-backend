<text>Popes and their rituals
Poets and rivals
Authority. Prestige
Pokes and tempts us
With so much cholesterol
See who porks out
On that old seizure salad.
One drop of politics, said Blok,
Just one, of that clarty leaven,
And a song posts itself
To the next generation.
Involuted ports and havens
Push it out.
