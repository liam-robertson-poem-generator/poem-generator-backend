<text>Crook and cook:
Skewer and grill;
Twist the rendering:
Pin him up and vanish.
For the shield-biting berserks
Lunch was the continuation of war indoors.
In Orkney, Rus' and maybe Saxo Grammaticus
The cook it was, with his scramasax,
Who'd to top the innocent kinsman come to parley,
The Latin cook forshriven by the martyred Norse.
Reverse takeover: the guest was the dinner
And the dinner consumed the host.</text>
