<text>A two-pin jolt of fear can cure
Uncertainty and doubt, enlight
Decisions you had fudged or
Stomp-box fuzzed to wow fund managers.
But when the adrenaline flood
Has you all but levitate by the scrotum
In that pompom-furred scut
My flop-eared friend
Your wet nose doing its Lady Macbeth
I can't help but think polenta.
