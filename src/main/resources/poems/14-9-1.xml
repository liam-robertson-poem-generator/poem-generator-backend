<title>Riddle me Ruff and Ree
</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>A riddle, a tipsy river, again
I'll try, but how to be?
How does the King of the Sheepfold
Sort his species, heck and ree?

The dead can have my residue
To bank or bury or sing.
Mine is the kingdom of joy and recognition
- With no king!</text>
