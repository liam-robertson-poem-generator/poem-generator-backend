<text>Sighs count - though what for, I wish.
Signs are- they, like countersignatories, lose it.
The geodesic sines of pedals and the counter-threaded
Splines thereon, along a wet road -
The cyclist smiles, rapt in ancient music.

The spine's relieved of its load, that bore you
My spies are everywhere, they know nothing
Sties and cataracts and river blindness
The skies are one inch from a head that doesn't see.

The way desire skives off a rigid self, maybe,
And swives as it must, the self sheers off its body
And strives to believe love doesn't need the props,
It strides ahead, of what? on what? and, tired of all these questions,
Slides at length into the padded box.
Scribes eke a living off the dead and the bereft -
A bridge from land to water, stiles on a stone wall at a cliff edge.
The dead are not a distant cousin in the States
Though what they are or whether, without substance
Style's nothing. I looked out my folks after years of neglect
In case some short-range sentience - who knows? -
Remains. Borrheid, the spires of Leverndale, Nielston Pad,
Argyll beyond and rain that scythes the heads from raincoat collars.
She's gone, my dear, and that's the size of it.</text>
