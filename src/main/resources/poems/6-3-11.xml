<text>Flaws in the rock.
Fern fronds.
Frogs agog
In fobs of water.
His gunsight fogs
And foils the hunter.
Fawns and does consider him
Then leave with the light.
Lucifer, when you ponder it, is the dark. No blame.
Night falls and forms shift, there's no clear shot
Where blustered bracken flogs the Atlantic spray
And starry clusters, faint as phosphorus all asplutter in the deep.
