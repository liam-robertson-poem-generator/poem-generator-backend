<text>The face in the snapshot tacked to the board was tracked down.
The hand behind the print on the thumb-tack tapped his phone and trapped him.
Tamped in a cell or cellar the monotony tramped him flat;
He was tasked with this and taxed with that but tact,
As in finesse, was not his thing:
The tract he'd hammered out theyâ€™d hauled him in for?
It was tit-for-tat stuff any twat could do. Yet to deceive
Is not a piece of tart or a meringue. He'd have had to practice.
He just got tanked and trashed the place.
