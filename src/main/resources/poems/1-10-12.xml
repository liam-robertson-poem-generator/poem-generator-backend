<text>Or how, far out in the Kalahari
You found, on the keel of a rock
Painted in the Bushman idiom
Animals long gone from there:
Ice.
Ice where ice is law and metal brittle
Colours blench in the reserve of all
Affection; the reverse, but the prerequisite,
Nearer than anything else on earth
To nought.</text>
