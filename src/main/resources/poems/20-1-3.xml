<text>When rhyme is a loop
And reason a circle
When nothing at work'll
Work out for the coop-
er of verse in the hoop
Of routine,  in the murk of
Loch Gloom with the snorkel
Bunged up, don't say "bloop",
Don't throw in the sponge at round
Ten. See, I've found
This horse shoe. Here, loos-
en your glove. To the ring,
Gaun and land a good swing,
It's his trapdoor and noose.</text>
