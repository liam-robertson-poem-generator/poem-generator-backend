<text>Keeps a tawse in his inside pocket
Toys with it, quick on the draw.
That isn't elbow-patch material:
More like a boot sole. The B class
Toils in delta S for silence.
Red-hot tongs, he's thinking, used to shed
Dim light on trolls and unter-
Menschen in their hemp and leather togs. The saints
In trons and dungeons were delivered
From this world with such forceps.
Such were the martyrs'
Terms of reference.
