<text>Sap recedes. The boughs of the beech
Rise out of reach, again. Why hang round
To be insulted? Slap of December,
Children suddenly too clever,
The scarp of beauty - steep. Zap it
And the other channel's deid. So
Stamp in the cold snap. Clutch at the littlest
Scrap of that tingle in the scalp,
Fraying strap.</text>
