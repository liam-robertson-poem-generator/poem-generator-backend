<text>Where wing meets flap it's written
In English and Chinese DO NOT WALK
OUTSIDE THIS AREA. Since it's six miles over Moscow
Moving at preternatural speed, that could go without saying.
And why does it say Air China in big letters? For the spy sats?
Why are the meals so bad and the drink so stingy?
Meals - now there's a word you don't see in
Poems. You might wonder what it means.
