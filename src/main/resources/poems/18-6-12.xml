<text>Hicks from the stacks and a sherry tutorial
Tux from the Styx of that old school slurry.
In it up to the hilts.
Sixties hits on the one hand,
Subtle hints on the other
Guide her hips.
Is this a point where I lost my way
Or crossed it? Lost a life?
In the cold of a sepulchre, coal gas heaters hiss.</text>
