<text>One hour out of time on the clock,
In the canteen, on the road to work
That boughs on oak trees measure.
Each of us on loan from just
This moment to the next.
Where's the lone wolf out of
Touch, the lone star out of language?
I'd better not complain.
Ontological proof of the wind's existence
Is gratitude in search of grace.
