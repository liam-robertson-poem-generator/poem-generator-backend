<text>All in all a bad gig:
Some prat, I mean some wozzek
Palped the thing in the
Tarpaulin. Did it no
Go into spasm? We'd
The safety drill off pat
But stiffs are just not meant to pant.
You harvest bits and plant the wrapping,
The remains. We'd planked some spares.
Turns out they'd rise to
'plashed', 'pranced'
where in fact they were parched and crottled,
sore patched up, past repair.
But that's language for you: part
Trap, part valve, a pact with the void.
We packed them down in preterite,
Parked them in the undercroft
Till all their tension passed.
