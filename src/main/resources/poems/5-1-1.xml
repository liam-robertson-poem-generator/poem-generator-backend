<text>Before you look
Before you can even see
It turns out
A vow was made for you.
He clicks file to view
She clicks agree and there you are.
You know they'd not have done that
Or you think I know my rights,
Let's renegotiate. But they start
To drop around you
And you know, this view:
It really is to die for.
