<title>A Night an the Opera</title>

<text>Stamp on the pedal. Soft white pelts the screen, a press
Of household pets and furry pests: you've crashed the cloakroom.
Leave the hatcheck 50 pence, keys in the ignition.
Perps on the door are quick to seize
Such perks to their condition:
Pecks on the cheek for the gift of a real
Mink coat. With skidmarks.
