<text>Silvershod hoofed it. Not hooked, for a spell,
To the sexual verbs have and be,
I went on a spending spree: books.
Yes I know they're hiding the carpet
But who gives a tarnished hoot? The moonatic's
Hooped with a nicotine rainbow.
Buy me this coin - Athena's Owl,
A silver bullet champed at the bit.
Slip it under my tongue when I leave you.</text>
