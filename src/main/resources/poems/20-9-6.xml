<text>The Roman who'd seen all the places and read all the books
Was watching the husbands register young women on the promenade
And everybody playing at never heed, when suddenly
Later, the leaf he twiddled between his thumbs
Still had red veins, and a green sail,
In all a hint of underwater gold. A shipwreck?
Either he had seen it all, which was a drag,
Or, well, he hadn't, and that was a real pain.
Would the second problem solve the first or just supplant it?
Was he happy now? Was she?</text>
