<text>Between her toes the grey sand glugs
And gloves her feet to the ankle.
Soon it gums her step. The tidal
Grubs emerge, their gubs are miming
Screams and girns of seagulls. Not
The way to go. Back at the beach house
The guard dozes, his gun on the table
A stranded fishing boat at the end of a rope
But guns are like that.</text>
