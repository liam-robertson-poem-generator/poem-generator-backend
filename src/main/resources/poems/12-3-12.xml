<text>When the joints are out of season
Senior management has its choice of
High retreats and beach resorts, a geographical
Box of chocs for business jaunts and business
Menus, slurps and chomps. Chocks away!
Organic scotch and soda by the pool
She jots her bullets, jaups a splash,
Chops what has to be cut, chalks up
A victory for what? Her suits,
Black as choughs, watch for tips.
Here's one: the joss in joss stick
Was the Portuguese for god.
'Joss pidgin' was religion.
'Joss pidgin politics?':
a game for pious pricks.
