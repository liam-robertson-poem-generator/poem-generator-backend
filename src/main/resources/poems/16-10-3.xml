<title>Selfie with Severed Head</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>This will have been self-timer on ninety seconds
An hour since they heard a rescue team was on its way
An hour till a drone concludes we are not a wedding party
A decade on from kirk and call of duty; four more
Would bring gripe about my dentures or dementia.
Turned to the lens. Here's looking at you.
