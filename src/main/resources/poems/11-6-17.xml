<title>A Snake-Eyed Skink</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Swick and swindle, swink and sweat, they're skint
To bind your bibles, mister
Spick and spanic, mister stick it to them smoke em out
They stink. Your lady
Slick enough in silk, contrives to slink
But clumps around as if the kitchen sink – 
You snick a putt and sink it – kitchen sink, I say,
Was chained to her ankle. Is she sick?
Best hand her that zinc bucket. Goes quite well
With her complexion (sic). And check the lip sync
When she makes your statement to the press.
