<text>Giz a kiss!
	Eh?
Gie us the keys.
		Oh.
Up to the gills on
God knows what.
Random gigs
At retro grills
Where girls and boys
Come out to play.
Smoky grids and griddles,
The owner girds her loins
And segues into brunch.
Another day! She grins.
The wee yin girns.
Do something about the
D&#233;cor. Who gilds
Plaster these days?
Mediaeval guilds.
She gives up.
