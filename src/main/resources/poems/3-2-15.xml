<text>On the island of Poros, said Anaximander,
Which, Anaximenes thought, did not exist,
Men sweat lard and the women sweat salt.
Shirts are flyped and scraped for suet
While the salt, which exfiltrated
Frank apparel
Is gleaned in flakes and plaques to make
The amphorae they use for cooling wine
To drink by lardy candle light
Under the pines at night
To Anaximenes!
