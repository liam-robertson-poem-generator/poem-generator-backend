<text>Wallace's guide on the Amazon
Cooks a vial of tree-frog poison.
-	'Want to put a drop in Darwin's gin?
-	Now that's such a vile idea!
Wallace's guide on the Amazon
Downs a butterfly with his blowpipe,
Packs it away in the sample box,
Sends it back to base.
Wallace's guide on the Amazon
Downs an elephant with his blowpipe.
-	But the Amazon doesn't have elephants!
-	Not no more.
