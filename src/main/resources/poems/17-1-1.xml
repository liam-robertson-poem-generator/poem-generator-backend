<title>Radio Caroline</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>The crew I can imagine: fresh and hopeful
As the queue of singles waiting to be spun.
But as to how a record deck could work on the North Sea swell
I have no clue. Did they have
A billiard table too, in the mess? the balls adrift
Like spirit-level bubbles, space invaders,
The cue - a lumbering, predigital cursor?
And a cow called Caroline on deck
To grow grass in the cowpats.</text>
