<text>The ranks were closed, they went to press
But trod that brittle phial of doubt.
In fifty years they haven't closed
The case; alibis are all off pat.
I mind festoons of cuttlefish cloud
Above the lamps, a sopping blotter,
Me weighing out the word ASSASS-
INATED: proof that though, like it,
I didn't show on Super Eight
Or Polaroid on the scene that day
I really wasn't there in case
That crackpot in the warehouse missed.
