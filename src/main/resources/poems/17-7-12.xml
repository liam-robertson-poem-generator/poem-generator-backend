<text>Nauseous, abrupt, it crests and crashes, but
Returns - the weight and the swell and the slide.
Chitinous rights and a chemical trail of obligations
Toil in clefts of a broccoli jungle, global lung
Where quests are doomed by complex ToR.
Meek commensal: what's your freedom for?
How famous is cress? How successful?
What vetches blazon, or change hands for, gold?
I set the little letters out as clefs on staves
So cutting keys to every pause and quaver.</text>
