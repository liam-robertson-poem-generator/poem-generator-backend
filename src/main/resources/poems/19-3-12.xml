<text>Wops - who needs them? Not policy wonks.
Cops chase them round like two noodles in woks.
Nail one of those perps and he walks,
He walks. Their lawyers are wasps,
Capable bastards to straighten the warps
And botox the warts, if that's what you do to them.
Who needs the grief? Who wants the - say,
What's a woman like you
Do 
In a clam bar like this?</text>
