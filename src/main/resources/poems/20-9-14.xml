<text>Good my liege
		(aside: moronic oxide)
					stay thy hand
For if this summer blizzard in concatenation with
A plague of locust be but static in a cathode tube
And we the poorly players in some 60s children's show,
Then better it were that we implore
The viewer on the Saracen divan
To smite the set.
All dismount and kneel.
The royal greyhound, on their leash,
Incontinent, also kneel.
WHACK! The air is clear! Ah, good my liege,
Would that all environmental troubles were so
CLICK.</text>
