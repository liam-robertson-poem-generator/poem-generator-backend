<title>Passing Out</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Another blade another blonde
The hero balled a government bond, em-
Broiled in white-tie fisticuffs.
They brawled in broad
Agreement as to rules
They bobbed and wove. When biffed
One neither bawled nor sniffled. Yet
Not bogged in protocol, when bombed, well,
Big boys' rules, what? Not so much hard-
Boiled as armour plated (with a 'u'). Although
Your tires are bald, old chap. A flat
Might land a bod in shit.
