<text>Whereas it's better to enter the Kingdom of Heaven
missing the offending limbs than not at all,
there's some truncations make this life impossible.
That's as it should be.

You wouldn't have wanted to live without your legs.
Under the knife, out on the trolley,
"laughing and joking with the nurses"
as they say,

till the post-op shock had cornered you
and drowned you like a kitten. Up!
on your tip-toes, up! and He'll lift
His Cathie over the Pearly Gates.</text>
