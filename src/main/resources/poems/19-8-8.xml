<title>The West</title>
<author>Peter McCarey /Charley Marley</author>
<text>Soft power'd wax or wane with the
Shellac, vinyl. TV. Drip fed,
Deep fried. String vest,
Wild West and every wean
A cowboy then Geronimo.
You rode the South Side wagon train
Or chained your bike to the paling.
John Wayne never had that problem with his horse.
