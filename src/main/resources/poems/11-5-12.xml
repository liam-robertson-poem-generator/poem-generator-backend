<title>Justice and Police (embossed on a man-hole cover)</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>An ant lays down a track
On ivory straths and ebony scarps
Sprats in a tin were never as tight
As the parallel wires arranged by gauge
On a rack in the camel's coffin
Yet the sound technician loops and stacks
His cables: a teenage bedroom,
Bad day on a flip chart.
The bassist slaps and claws at it
Like he didn't know straps have hooks.
Jacques steps up and spanks the keyboard.
The box snaps back. He rubs its body, smacks it. This
Gets out of hand. The drummer stamps
And saps a speaker, scraps with the bassist
Who scalps a hi-hat. Though reduced to slats
The Strat is quite an ax. The scamps
Whose manners music sweetens aren't
Helping with the crime stats.
In all this, where's the sax? Backstage
He scarfs up chemical snacks till his slacks
Are tight as his embouchure.
The impresario slants in -
Comical spats and outsize puro -
'You're all fired', he snaps
But the iron stanks to an ancient
Cistern underneath the cellar
Served as gongs in the last performance.
Splat's the word, or splop, perhaps,
To put the lid on it.</text>
