<title>Trrism
</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>A gnarly tree and every flower
Full as a louche. A dust arcade
With billiard hall, two travel agents,
A plastic surgeon, some antique shops.
A wild smell of pork and antiperspirant.
"A big sword, then? Abu Sayyaf
Sold these to buy their M-16s!"
A Song grenade, sweet celadon.
Flip-flop in the heat as though
Your spine were a stem, your self
An insect bathing in the calyx.</text>
