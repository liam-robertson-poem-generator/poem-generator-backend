<text>The school bell, if you muffled it,
Would throb like a belted hand.
Nae tother a baa, nae bother at aa.
Plier handles grip a tin of scotch broth
The opener gnaws around the rim.
That and a square of 3-D printed cheese,
The heel of a loaf. That and the Latin homework.
You and me, brother, both.
