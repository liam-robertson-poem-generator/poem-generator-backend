<title>Proposed Amendments
</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>That heat increase in Spring
That light wax into Fall.

That politics find a more appropriate model than the lek
(Where female capercaillies choose their partner).

That death be one of those things,
Like getting rich, which some encounter,
And love - ineluctable.</text>
