<text>I take the law into my own hands
Beauty touches and forgets
Racing through women as you'd run across lily pads
 
The law is only old it is descriptive. Beauty
Discards it too. Young poets
So many old solicitors
Bang their pencilled fist on writing pads.
 
It wouldn't know it needed
Sexes and sentences
Cultural grime.
