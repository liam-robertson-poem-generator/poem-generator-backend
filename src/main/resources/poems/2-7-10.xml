<title>Not by Bread Alone</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>On the river bed
On the river bend
On shingle such as caddis worms compile
Where frail signals bred
Though some of them don't so much breed as
Blend and subdivide
What bled in the rush, in the rushes
Belled and shunned for its native sly
Would have begged, the fallen, would have begged.
