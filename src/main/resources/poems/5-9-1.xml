<text>I've known these twenty years when I was beat.
I've learned to see this woodland make
A scrapyard of the lower visible spectrum,
A raptor without a wingbeat cross a quarter of the sky,
A thread of what must be gossamer in the blue
Go over the trees in the slovenly, trailing V of migrant birds;
Here and again I have my say.</text>
