<text>Irrefutable, and unconvincing,
said David Hume of Bishop Berkeley's argument
that a tree unseen by anyone in a wood
is undemonstrable and does not exist.
Hume wouldn't let in God for the trees to root in His attention,
nor would he let the leprechaun of reason from his grip,
but the thought that those elaborate dendrological arrangements
were a class that snapped to attention when the teacher turned
from the board
must have driven him crackers (I can see him in the staffroom).
Don't fret: the raptor that patrtols Ben Vorlich
brings great clefts of pine to be as it seeks out other things;
the cushioned thump at the back of the woodpecker's skull,
the stuck of sap when it wags itself like a dog that grips a stick,
the ramp and tilt of slaters in the gullies of its bark
suggest that, yes, the tree is there. Says Berkeley, 'show it to me!'
I can't. and when I fly away from Scotland,
packing it carefully down in cotton wool for another year,
when I think of it, near as old as any tree,
am I using a Roman stone for a step? Is this the last
light from a done star reeling into my eye like a measuring tape?
