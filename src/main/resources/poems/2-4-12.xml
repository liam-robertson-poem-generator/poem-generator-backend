<text>Once upon a bus processing
Faces, butts and busts, irregular
Bursts of lurch and go as it
Blurts its sample at a stop
Commutable births, come on, get off,
But that was us, Beijing. The thing
Cavorts and bumps along
The ruts and bluffs of tar. Its driver
Burps and buffs his occiput.
This young woman, standing next to me,
Puts her head on my shoulder, falls asleep.
On into town, her skull, my collarbone,
Nothing else. Till one alights
And we're back to the sound and sense Time blunts and hones,
A gamelan duo that busks so slow
You'd think it a chess match
Where they take to their charpoi bunks between two moves
Or have a smoke, till, whack! the xylophone bucks:
What proves to be the last note bulks and fades.
