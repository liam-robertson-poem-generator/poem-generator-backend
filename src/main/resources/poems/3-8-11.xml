<text>Rhythm paves the way
Sense is made of mops and pails
In water on cement. It pares away
Then planes and sands and buffs
Whatever pays, whatever works.
Beyond the pale's a hunger garden,
Ruddy pears intact. The plains are parched
A cropper prays and offers fireweed for tinder.
Gods in pairs are glimpsed - if ever - through refractive panes.
Give praise. Take pains. The warden preys on the redundant.
His daughter plays.
