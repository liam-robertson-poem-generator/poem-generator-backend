<text>Three sisters, long widowed, the last time they'd meet,
On their primary teacher 'oh she was a targe!'
I'd to look that one up: a violent scold,
A shrew, a virago (19th, Ulster Scots).
Are you not all ashamed to speak ill of the dead?
Not a bit! We know
That she is in heaven's perpetual light
Down on her knees, begging God to forgive her
For all the rotten things she did to us.
