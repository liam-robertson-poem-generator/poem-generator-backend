<text>He was a knave, a jack tar in the Swiss
Navelry, where names and nouns part company
(Renown has made a name for itself, aye aye, but the nays
Will have it). The nightmare neighs and sleepers sweat
Resin. No nails in the wood, where capsized keels
Are set on ruddy piers to roof the nave.</text>
