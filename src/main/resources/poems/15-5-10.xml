<text>for Abdelaziz Kacem

Oriental island in the West
A jaw that hinges in Jerusalem
Savours Arab rhetoric and Gallic
Points of honour: intemperate,
Intemperate dialogue of the deaf.

Old Sarfati has siphoned off the last of the Berber silver
With the iodine from salt
Where gullies yarned in nothing
Bezoardic memory of water you devine
In many a dusty yard.</text>
