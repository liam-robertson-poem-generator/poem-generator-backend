<title>Oisin

<text>To a Renfrew auntie, I was Peter-og,
Og, young, as in "Tir-nan-Og", the Land of Youth;
My dad knew that much Irish. In the War,
One Major Bellringer had asked his mother
If her son could serve in Eire; she said No, her son would not
Go back to the land of his ancestors a spy.

Oisin stayed in Tir-nan-Og so long, when he returned
He found his race replaced by Hom. Sap. sap..
Home? he smiled as he withered, Now where would that be? But our man
Thomas of Ercildoune went west for just on seven years,
Emerging numinous and
Rattling rich as Mungo Park.</text>
