<title>A Demagogue

<text>This is where it all unhappens
One can only seep so far
Reed antennae pronged like lynx's
Ears to the wary wind plod in the pond
Palled in silt that reeks and ponged
Of pod and body pawned and unredeemed
The frog is prince. It pawed the piper
Paused and said  'Applaud, my flaccid friends
for we are poised to take
The rooty river green reflective reaches.
Never in all my speeches
(Prod the air and scan the audience)
Never in all my speeches
This is where it all unhappens
Never in all my speeches
One can only seep so far</text>
