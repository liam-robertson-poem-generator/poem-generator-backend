<text>They culled the individualists
And clubbed the demonstrators;
Real fear curbed the old intelligentsia.
The train from Moscow to Vladivostok
Took five minutes short of a week.
A straight line from one to the other
Would have gone down a steep cellar stair
But they clung to the curved face of the earth
The curd and the honey, the pasture and cud.
Queues, as for the sacrament, shuffled and
Curled on every public space of the Soviet Union.</text>
