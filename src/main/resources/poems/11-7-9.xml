<poem>
<title>For Iris Perrin</title>

<text>On a pillow of husky spelt she slept
Or laid her head. 'Eye hath not seen',
Said Simple, 'Nor ear heard': it's not
A  videoconference. She stretched
And yawned. Stepped through the screen,
A shiver of smelt in icy stream,
A local, all set with his net, but
Missed her. She swept through.
They sketched and posted her ID. A Celt
(they mispronounced it), of what sept and sect (mis-
Spelt, but stet). They searched; they spent their
Last red cent on facts to smelt for data. Nada. She
Said 'Can't catch me. I'm not a virus
In your badgers' sett, the stent and shunt
Of stressed and twisted politic.
Sexed and rooted things are of the essence.
What you smelt as sweat
Was scent to me: the zest of it all
I sensed and love'.
