<text>Poems never written down
Pebbles in the ocean's throat
Lagavulin's tawny shine
Claret's memories of oak
That never took to shingle beach
Or saw its seasoned rings would rhyme
In rosined ships, in reels of mine;
We're fiddles sunken in their song
From peg to bridge, Across the briny
Ocean-o to Capricorn
From Uist, garrisoned with sheep
And two-and-twenty (count them) years
Asleep in postcards. Out of the blue
A curving swell will hit the shore
From  blistered winds in ecstasy
That none survived, or no one knew.</text>
