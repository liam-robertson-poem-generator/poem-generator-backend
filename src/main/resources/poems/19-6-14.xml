<title>Snapshot

<text>If she'd asked him to dance
He couldn't have been more
Ungainly. Freeze and say cheese!
Stick em up and relax!
Then there's her, in cahoots with the camera
Make a wish.

The wings on this big boeing
Twang in the winch of inconvenient
Weather. The usual voltage runs
A torch of shadows
By which I pick my way.</text>
