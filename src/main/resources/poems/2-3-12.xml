<text>The boss has been told to think
Outside the box. He starts
By wondering just what
Box he's to think out of. His bonce?
He balks at that, sure reason blocks
The bristling brocks of fight and flight in murky setts,
The broths of blood that turn his breath to
Undecidable Rorschach blots.
So what?
