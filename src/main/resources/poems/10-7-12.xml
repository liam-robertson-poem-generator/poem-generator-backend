<title>High Table
</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Desks grumble. Class rises for the guest.
In Soviet car plants
Where dearths were factored in
To personal debts
Steel was siphoned into skillets
Clutchplates came out as dense
As osteoporotic delft:
He decks the pedal and the brake surprise surprise
Dents in the bumper - a brace of roadkill.
Deaths for dinner, darling, one ought to dress.</text>
