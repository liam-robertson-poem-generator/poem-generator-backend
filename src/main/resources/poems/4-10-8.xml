<title>The Spirit of British Administration</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>It's all about the queen: 'She wills
All the time, all those laws - she broods
Over this body of laws and institutions'.
20,000 at my bidding speed.
More countermine the country without rest
For I am C.H. Cisson, this is 1959
'Appointments and promotions inside ministries
Reserved for Scotsmen, Welshmen, and women'.
Keep the half-crown heft of that last comma. For all that
This English island: it is mine.
