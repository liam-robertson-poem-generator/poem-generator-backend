<title>Karma Gadelica</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>The Minch a glittering bridge to the ocean
A mishmash of beaches, machair and cliff
No midge is a nuisance
No pluke is a rash
No man is an island
Some of us, but,
Are nuisances and rash
Which accounts for sebacious eruptions
And burning clouds of midges
On Rhum.</text>
