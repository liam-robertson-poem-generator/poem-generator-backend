<text>Bling bly blot he brought his goods
To market. See who bought 'em? This one
Balked at the dollary. Blot he bopped him
On the hooter, boxed his lugs.
Market regulator caught him,
Bonked his capital, smacked his bot,
Blocked his credit. Ruled that Blotty's
Merchandise, though blotched and dreck em-
Bossed, was nowise - vultures have to eat - 
Was nowise botched.
