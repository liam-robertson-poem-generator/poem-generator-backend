<text>One of the vets, by which I mean
The veteran veterinarians
Of the first vegetarian war,
Trekking the frosty veldts
Whurr Boreas vents his chanter,
Returns, as he stamps out leagues and versts
To vex the question of causality
And concludes that starting writing verse
When he vetoed the string vests
Was not a simple post ergo propter hoc.
