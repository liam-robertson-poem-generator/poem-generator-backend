<text>Turkic hordes gallop into history. Out of it
The rabble hones its hoes and spades but dulls its wit
With work. It holds its hurt in prayer
Hoves into song on Friday nights and Sundays
Their homes with hardly room for stiff pianos
Holes in the stethoscope rubber hose on bathtaps
Hoards of vintage boxing cards in tins.
