<title>Bush</title>

<text>An old party game-cum-psychological test had me describe
A wood, a path, a watercourse, crossing it, and so on.
When asked to describe the path I said there is none ...
Each word is rooted in time and reaches out across its congeners;
The only way round one is through another.
I've found myself climbing up a fallen tree towards its roots,
Balancing on wattle, hacking through an argument when it wouldn't let me go,
Till the only thing is this negotiation of dendrites that fork and twine,
And the only other hope'd be some apocalypse - grey boughs
That grow as you watch; a thousand years of blossom in a minute - the burning bush.</text>
