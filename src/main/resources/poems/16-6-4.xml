<title>Ministr molchanija
</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Grim is fine by me: there's a glimmer of
Something draws me through the gloom
In a grammar of crystal. Sober, even
When quite drunk on wine. Molchi,
Skryvaisja i tai
I chuvstva i mechty svoi: the glamour
Of another voice.</text>
