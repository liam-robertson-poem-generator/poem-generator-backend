<text>May Margaret she laughed
Intil his arms as asleep she lay
No joke. All night they'd larked
But Clark now lacked a heart
Beat. The door un-
Latched, its withers lashed, that
Ride was gone, gone. Lanced
-	it's boils you lance, not lovers -
By the seventh of her brothers
As dawn fog-lamped the chamber
She lapsed into awareness
The sheet had lapped his blood with hers
She has the last word:
There'll neither coal nor candle light
Burn in my chamber evermair.
