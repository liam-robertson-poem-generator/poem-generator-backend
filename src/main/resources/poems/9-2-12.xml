<text>A wren on the branch above his head
In the mango orchard round an ancient stupa.
This is bliss! He tokes his pipe.
He didn't know the Indians had wrens.
But they didn't know that Cornishmen had sharks.
Rehearsing the honoured tropes with which it's done
He toasts absent friends. That takes a while.
A servant totes the tiffin hamper back to barracks.
