<text>The character for woman
As she knelt to set the table
Perfectionism tending imperfection

In the mask of a young girl, she
Would not see me in my old mac
A tiddlywink on the go board

Nor indeed did I mark her.
So the rushmat room, a willow
By the bridge, those black canals,

Incense in the hallway,
Paper lamps at shin height, and
Oh the sudden quiet as I turn a corner now

Will not recur with the character for woman.</text>
