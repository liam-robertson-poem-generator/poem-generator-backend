<title>Guzzle
</title>

<text>If thunder's one of the seven deadly sins
Then so is bragging to me about your means
And sharing nothing. Show me another drunk
That binges only on other people's wines.
No don't: leave your wag on the wagon.
Confronted with a ticket machine, in shock
You pat your pockets till someone else stumps up.
I leave you there. For what
Depresses the dinner out of me
Is that praise you lavish:
It must be really cheap.</text>
