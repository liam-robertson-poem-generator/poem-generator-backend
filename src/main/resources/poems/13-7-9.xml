<text>The spring migration slowed like a freight
And smacked the buffers, bringing down
The snow's oblivion of fifty years.
The kites were here from Africa three weeks early, lost in peace.
They were the magic word that, by the weekend,
Routed the old r&#233;gime.
Old ladies pulled their dogs from under sofas,
Hoovered them and radio-controlled them through the park.
My memory woke with neither shent nor shame.</text>
