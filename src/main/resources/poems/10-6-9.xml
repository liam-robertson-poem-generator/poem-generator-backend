<text>All dit and no dah, the robin is
One fearsome featherweight. Remorse? Not a whit of it.
By dint and by drift its eyes have dipped
To where most folk keep their ears:
It's got a head like a squid.
As season after season dripped,
Dished out rosettes and ditched them, Robin
Stood by the path, chest out, expecting
The L&#233;gion d'honneur.</text>
