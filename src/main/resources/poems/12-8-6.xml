<title>On Reading John Berryman's "11 Addresses to the Lord"

<text>John Henry, Cardinal Bones, if I can't pray
I'll write my wrongs as you did. Intercede
for me when I succeed you on that day
to the howling chair, where I maun chafe and bleed
till you - word, voice and corpse as never broken,
swack and singing glory karaoke -
don't make me laugh.</text>
