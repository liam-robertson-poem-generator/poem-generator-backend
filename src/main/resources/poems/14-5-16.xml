<title>Artou / Off the Map
</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>In the map shop, the music playing
Was John Coltrane so far away
So far away, some rag-top Rolls
Of a raindance raga, Indian English plosives
In the tabla's Vedic commentary.

The map I took to be Tamil Nadu
Explained itself as Hindu Kush
(As fingerprinted by the Swiss).
As I looked down to touch the names
In the folds of Kashmir beaten in lines

By nimble hooves and bangled heels,
Srinagar joined Schiehallion
(the first hill caught in contours), Lochnagar,
And every trait I'd flatten out, beyond my span
Of days for sensing the ribcage rise, a country's cadences.</text>
