<text>A gravel drive, a motor park
A message on the doorbell: go
Around the outhouse, where the lawn
Swoops down like a darkened cinema
A room projects from the house above
One flock of yachts, a candle lit
Pavilion on a silver sea.
The mortgage owners never showed.
I fled. It rained. Civility.
Joe Pass, put down that guitar
And tell me, if you know,
That every drop is counterweighted
In another life -
The one in black that ought to wear
Just flame red, and not much of it.
Whose every dream is sunk and countersunk.</text>
