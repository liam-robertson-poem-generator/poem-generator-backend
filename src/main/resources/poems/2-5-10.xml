<title>Oh I Do Like To Be</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>He blagged his way in, bagged another
And bragged again. All told
That barbed and liquid muscle blabbed too much
We barred him. He barged in
Press-badged the doorman banged it in his face
For he was banned. No more would the brass band play
His theme, that brand too hot to handle.
A has-been bard, tiddly om pom pom
Bad news.
