<text>Not muffled groans again!
Can't all get golds.
Delaney goads his donkey bristles
Browses rocks in olive groves
And gores the brick-red dirt.
It goes nowhere. And gets there.
Round it, a bubble around breath,
A market grows, a theatre, it the aria
(No Callas). How the audience,
Shelves on shelves, glows about its bristle wick.
The goals of their economy shift and swell,
The globes of this megalopolis.
