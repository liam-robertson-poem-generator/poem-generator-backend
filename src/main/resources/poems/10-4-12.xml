<text>The drunks are tanking up. A real man
Duffs up his partner, while on campus
The dux dumps the dunce.
She dunks him one last time
Then dusts him off her r&#233;sum&#233;.
He ducks out of her life, not realising
That's what's happened. Dunts a pillar,
Doesn't care. A murmur in its ear,
The dusk's taken him in so gently.</text>
