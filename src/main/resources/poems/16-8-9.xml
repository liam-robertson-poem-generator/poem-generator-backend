<title>Prison Camp at Prony; Whales beyond the Reef
</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>A mind at odds with its body clock
Drove a bow wave through fords
Juddered on laterite to where reef
And mangrove grate the ocean,
Dish it up in prison soup. Can't slip the net.
No ship to unlock a gate to the tallow
Archipelago, the cool school of depth and distance.
Just a crabwise gait in the rocks,
The crab's interrogation: Are you so great?
I am. So good? No.  What good greatness?
Do you love? I've known love. Not the question;
If you don't love, then say, and leave. All morning,
From the shed where men hauled wood
To the mine where iron held them, haunted.
Hatred has no right to rule on love,
I saw at last: this wasn't about me. Look:
Here is where the enemies of empire
Died. The banyan strangling that gaol
Is rooted in their bones. Injustice
Stops the dead from sleeping. May they rest.</text>
