<title>On Two Lines Crossed out by E.Bishop</title>
<author>E. Bishop / P. McCarey</author>
<text>"The Princess dressed in white, the orphan,
The child who died and lay in the white coffin"
The Vampire dressed in black, the flirt,
With Hammer Horror silk red lining,
Fearful cramp in the vamp of her
Riding boot. 'Cool casket, dude, pale throat
But say - do you come here, orphan?'
