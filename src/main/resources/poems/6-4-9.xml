<text>Last things first: as pensioners fussed
About their plans it all went phut.
The Eocene, fucked and shorted once too often,
Pulled its credit. Peer reviewers
Fluffed the catch; away they're flushed.
Practical reason fluffed the re-sit. Off
To the occluded front we go
To throw stones at storms.
