<title>Leviathan</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>in memory of Giulio Regeni
Pluck a quill, dip in and scrawl
Your bloody judgment:
Humanity as biomass
Equivalent to krill in the cold ocean
Whose convection
Renders them in a vertical commute
To the vertebrate.
In the belly of the beast, the fact remains
That every day you torment,
Maim and kill a child of God
Brings that judgment closer.
