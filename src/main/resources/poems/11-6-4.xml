<text>They wrapped the squirm in squabbling clothes
And laid him in a casket. One of those
Coptic dugouts, with an icon for a lid, a wooden sim card.
His brow was polished oak,
His candid raiment as the scrim that held the planks together
To skim the waters of night and Nile, to sink or swim
To float, indeed, and stop in slim bullrushes.
None of which made much sense until the schism
When mutually exclusive, equally plausible
Narratologies were born.</text>
