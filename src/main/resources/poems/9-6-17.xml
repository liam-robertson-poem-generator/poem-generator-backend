<text>A sheep tick engorged in my forearm,
Its wings like an artichoke leaves sticking up?
but here's the trick: it was a cyclamen.
Now root it up gently; there's
Barely a graze,
There's hardly a tic of discomfort,
And carry it, rinky tink tink, to the house.
Is that borage or cress on my bicep?</text>
