<title>Moss Trooper</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Show me the motte at ten I couldn't storm,
The mossed and rusted yett the moist
Walls of a bottle dungeon I could not
Have dropped a hempen rope
To free the prisoners, who would not
Have mopped up the resistance,
Flung me down and mocked.
