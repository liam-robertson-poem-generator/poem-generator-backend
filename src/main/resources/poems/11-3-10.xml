<text>The sod! She sobbed
And snogged him one last time.
Mark's men had slogged for ever over
Evidence (and evident it was)
Now they'd solved it,
Which spoiled everything.
Even her lap-dog soiled its cushion.
Mark stormed into the hut and there they were,
Asleep in bed, a naked sword between them.
He retreated to the greensward. What the fuck?!
Forensics swarmed everwhere, swabbed everything.
She swanned off; spawned only gossip.
He went and sprawled in his den. On vellum
Scrawled a counterversion. As
The heavy squad hit the front door
He was sneaking out the back.
