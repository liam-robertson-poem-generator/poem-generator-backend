<text>A rook will perch in the fog the time it takes to write a poem.
At least one knows the Russian for cottage cheese
And croaks tvorog at the dairy maid in Stariy Pitergof.
On a chequerboard kitchen floor it won't play chess, though,
Nor can it get its head round its reflection in a glass. Just so
Did Thales struggle with eclipses of the sun.</text>
