<text>There was a wee house
On a big plot
Planned and planted with figs and cherries,
Oranges, lemons, grapes and apricots.
The mountain over the roof
Peeks at the sea.
First house it was this side of the track,
Now most of the town is here.
In the clean tilth of the orchard
Another house has erupted
In broken flags and tackle,
Rusty shade and tinder left from winter.
One olive tree, new planted, that could live as long as this,
But even Horace, a local man,
Won't outrun the race of the hoe,
Here's to them. There's a beer in the vaccine freezer,
A chopping block in front of this chair
Looks fit to hold a glass.
I haven't done a fair day's work in my puff;
Not starting now.</text>
