<title>General Winter</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Check / change down / exit / slow
ice under snow.
Sliproad slide and
the steering bridles.
Fresh fall drift
you have to dig
to find out what you used to know
Just the hush the
scurf of corky trees
collapsing crystals like collapsing trees
Snows like coalbeds consolidate
there's a road here somewhere I'll find it.
