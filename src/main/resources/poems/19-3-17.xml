<text>We walk, that's what we do. We walk and think.
Big head, slim hips, tough parturition. We inflict.
Infliction is our thing. Stir-fry the biosphere.
Some wonk says Man may not survive
But life will. Cool. Fire off some bugs
A megacolony of hardy beetles; lots of dung
And beetle juice; a dictionary and wiki rocket science.
By the time they reach the nearest plausible planet
They'll have sussed which way is up.
