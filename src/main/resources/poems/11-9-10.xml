<text>Ee ree reed creed screed scree sri see
The sea'd have receded if seeded with stone
If stoned and sere seared. What speed speared
Steed steered. Sri Lingam (Holy Wullie) smeared
With butter sneered a prayer as something
Juddered against the wall that screened him
Seethed and screamed. He might have steeled himself
And skiied to hell on all those drifts of seed that
Seemed that seamed to powder off like chastened snaw, but naw.
The crystal Cree.</text>
