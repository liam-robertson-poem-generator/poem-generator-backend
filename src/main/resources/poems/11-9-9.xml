<title>The Sound of Sleat</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Zen tinnitus. The sail was steeped in
Soggy snow, white noise
Seeped into the rations,
The sweet rationale of pleasure boats
That snuck in the wrong side of bed with the wind
To get turfed out the other; back in, so on.
Short wave splutter and screeched,
Fibres quaked and squeaked.
It was all so much
Like drawing a bow from a seat on the arrow
We shot through the water, far from the roads
On grey street.
