<text>Qualms on the lochan
Kraals on the veldt
Morning calms an anxious vigil
Crags around the village are just that:
Big stones.
A script of cams and tappets
Crabs and seizes over time
Though it crams with sound and sense
With carbs and protein so to speak
It clams up.
Hackney cabs leave town, as
Full as whelks. The clans are gathering
What? Whatever: glacial calves and
Pringle scarves, those cans of Baxter’s soup,
Scotch broth. I wonder who carves off
The chewy bits, what cads are scraping gristle
To add bulk. Meanwhile the cars return
And gently drool. Morning clads the tower blocks
In bling. Whatever cards you're dealt
You show your hand, eventually, you’re back
To case départ, to square one.
