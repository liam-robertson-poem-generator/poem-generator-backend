<text>After a week we drove down from the snows
and woke to find primroses in the park behind the house
where, after about ten minutes, she got fed up playing football.
I'm bored, she said, and smiled. Can I climb the cherry tree?
I got her bike from its place in the neighbour's garage
and this time I'd mislaid the pump adaptor:
she must have got to ride it all of a dozen times
since we bought her it three years ago. Three years.
Metabolism takes her at ten metres per second squared
away from me.</text>
