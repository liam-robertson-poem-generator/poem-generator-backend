<text>The thing is primed and glossed,
The syllable prised apart, the pie-eyed poet
Plied with drink and heaped or piled with praise,
Rolled in a rug and trampolined.
He pined for the days when collectors prized his work
And no one pried.
Wet wedges, heavy as Balzac,
Slung on flimsy, patent straps:
The penitential finery of women â€“ 
It isn't about men
Or for their pride.
