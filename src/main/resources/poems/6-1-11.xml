<text>Frowns
To project his thought
Beyond the bridge of his nose
Founds an institution
To project it rather further.
The institutional thought police
Fouls up, though; roots and flowers
Prise it apart. But then
The green fuse through which the flower is driven,
Or green flues, through which biofuel gets sucked
(Fumes of chlorophyl, some turned to seductive fumes)
In special feuds and battles over needy foods
Are just this fools' paradise in fugues of replication;
The institution might serve us yet.
