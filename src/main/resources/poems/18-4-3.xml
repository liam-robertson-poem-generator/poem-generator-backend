<title>McCarey in Moscow, 20 years on</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Spring is wiping itself on pavements
Watch the diesel ice and slicks
The bow waves from mud mobiles
Folk flooding down the lipid marble crypt
And crush
Where feet still shuffle though the guards are gone
Two escalators dwindle up and down
Synaptic trails have fizzled out on Gorky
St Basil's setting over that cobble hump
My shadow bigger than Mayakovsky</text>
