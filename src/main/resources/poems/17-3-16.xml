<text>The first wheel you can bet
Was clog-shod; circular
Tictactoe. The first manned flight
Was feather-fledged, and flapped.
Machines don&apos;t need that skeuomorphic stuff.
Recycle tyre-treads as flip-flops
No skin off their nose. Baptize yourself
A cog in the wealth condenser
Language too is otiose. Sabotage
Sabotage, though, they find that problematic.
