<text>Two days at the kitchen table with Ushakov
(Moscow, 1938), 4 vols, dark,
Dark green cloth cover, I chewed
At Pasternak ("Parsnip")'s early books of verse.
Russian-English: brazier, brocade,
Girt, adze, muzzles, sleepers, oven door, vitriol,
Biscuit barrel, eagle owl, door curtain, abscess,
Salt pans, Tatar tax collector, runrigs, ingot,
Misfire, mapping pen, Adam's apple, alder,
Weighman, buffalo, farthingale, meltwater,
Catkin, fibril, crossbill, stilts, zinc white,
Firebox, systole, crossbow - straight syntax,
Strong, simple beat of a young heart, constant
Fretting about the weather. Pagan
Pilgrimage for me, who dug the lexical landscape
More than the shiny CIA facsimile
Of the legendary 60s Soviet edition. Still,
The smart thing to do back then
With your Dylan Albert Hall concert bootleg
Was swap it for this and learn some Russian.</text>
