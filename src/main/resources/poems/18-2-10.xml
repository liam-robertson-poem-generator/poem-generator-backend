<text>The god of the horde
Homed in on Palestine
That honed its stubborn ploughshares;
It worked and hoed its peasants,
A lichenous arrangement not worth
Scraping off the rock, which is why St Andrew
With his hoard of Dead Sea skaith
Hosed the fish guts off his bib
And hoist the lot: sail, saltire and purse-seine net,
To hold course for Fife, slow punctured
By relic-hunters after nine-inch nails.
