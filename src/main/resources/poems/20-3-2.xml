<title>Apollo Belvedere</title>

<text>There's scarce enough to keep her vest and breeks up
But he's watching her not me. She looks this way. He sees
Her gym shoes worn like clogs, to keep the heels free
In the heat (she should try being marble).
An empty brow, three traits for eyes and mouth - no, wait:
Two dots that slide behind the lids, like drops on a rail â€“ she does have eyes.
Two commas - that would be her flaring nostrils. Canons change,
Popes also, even gallery attendants. There,
He'll rip the sketch out, lob it at the bin
And she'll move on.
