<title>Paracelsus</title>

<text>Pygmy, gnome - the name was immaterial
To bubbles of the earth they navigated,
Melancholic getters of gold and silver. Listen
To how they cough and what they tell you,
Miners, smelters. Thousands of years they died their evil death;
What doctor or philosopher among you, till him,
Knew where your coin was from or sounded airways
Plated with metal smoke?
