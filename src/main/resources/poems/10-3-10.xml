<text>Sumptuously drawered as a Louis XV chest, he met the day.
Daubed silk; yes, quite.
He donned a white shift. It dawned on him, now he was dolled up
To the nines, one of his men had just drawled back at him.
Think: dod of mince in the menagerie; tremble
And obey. He'd dodged and counterpunched for forty years;
Now was he dogged
With courtiers too stupid to be scared?
