<title>Peter The Hun</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Hun hone horn-handled gully:
Hun hungry.
Han Dynasty hangry. Want Hun
Die nasty. Han hain
Hen and hoon, dubloon and hong
Behind a big wall;
Hung a line of Hun, they go
Hing! Hang! Hong!, like Fr&#232;re Attila.
Peter spray his name on wall, and
Tongs ya bass. Go west, young man.</text>
