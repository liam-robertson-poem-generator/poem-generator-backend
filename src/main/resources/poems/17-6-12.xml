<text>Autumn quilts the valley labour quits in kilts and kaftans;
Kit in chests and bundles worn down with stop and search.
A quince tree at the crossing. Clinks of cutlery. A seat belt
Clicks. The Kinks with Thank You for The Days. I get my kicks
Cash to wire home. The local kirks are far from full. The clergy
Has its little quirks, its tonsured quiffs, its cliffs of fall.
One skippers and kips in doorways; the polis clips his coupon,
Unoriginal quips on either side. Unseasonal heat
Crisps and crimps the foliage. Someone's singing Ae Fond Kiss
To a face he hardly minds.</text>
