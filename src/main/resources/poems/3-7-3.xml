<text>This is a pep talk men. I tell you
You're going to go in there
And you're going to go in there prep
Prep. Prep. Would someone help me?
That was a perp walk. Man you just can't
Bundle a president out of the courtroom
Heel of your hand on the crown of his head
Like he couldn't duck into a car by himself.
You're going to go in there: I wish
That I was going in there with you guys.
Only fooling.</text>
