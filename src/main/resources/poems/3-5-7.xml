<title>By Land or Sea</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Griffin, there is a path -
Wriggle to the middle of the lettuce, sleep -
Under the tree, wrapped in vellum sketch maps, it
Leads, you follow, wary.
That angel clothed in the sun is just
A boy, an oxherd. Learn from the ox
To stray from pain when you need to,
To stray from griffin.
Watch for the drone that guards a hoard
To spend in India, where every year is the first
With a girl 3/4 black, 4/4 lovely. Thinking back,
You might wonder at a ship that you once saw in the roads,
The Finn MacCool.</text>
