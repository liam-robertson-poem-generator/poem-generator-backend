<text>Scads of goods and scams to get them. Chat up slags at pottery slams.
Strads are fiddles and psalms are rants. Stags are trophy ruminants. Spam's
Where I.T. sinks in its sands. It saddens and snags your songs and goods
That might have gathered up all the strands of the delta.
Your span's abridged. Selves are salves on nothing,
Sags in canvas straining spars and sheets.
What scans? Pretty scarves on the livid and the living scabs and scars.
With his eyes tight shut he stands and starves the light of any sense. The sun stabs at him, and the other stars.</text>
