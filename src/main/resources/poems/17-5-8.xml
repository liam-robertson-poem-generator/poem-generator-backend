<text>Swimming through the ribcage of the whale
To leave the krang behind.
If you can, why don't you? Eh?
The snow recedes like a banker's hairline. Clang!
You have 30 seconds, starting
Now. What connects the peaks across the valley
To the price in the local 'tique shop of
A water jug, a yoke and brick
bed platform heated underneath? Hint:
Alpine real-estate futures. Wrang!
Two crate of lobster in the boot of a Bentley.
Oh to be - just somewhere else
When the gowfers motor in, them and their wee dugs.
You'll mind the Clan McCann - especially Genghis.</text>
