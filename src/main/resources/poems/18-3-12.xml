<text>The horse is gone.
Schoolgirls tend the flame
Ignited Nietzsche's madness
Hoists him with his own his own
Conclusions. As it all hots up
The wise man takes a powder, hops it.
A horseless carnage honks in:
The hawks have it. Blighty is
Haufs and hauf-pints in a pub.
Snowline down to treeline
Where a chalk horse haunts the hill.</text>
