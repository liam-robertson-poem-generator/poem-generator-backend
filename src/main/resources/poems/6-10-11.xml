<title>Freedom Fries</title>

<text>He played cricket, my dad. You can whack
Fours and sixes, but fives are a slog,
What with fires invading the pitch.
And then poems are on-the-spot fines;
They take time - and for what? Wee phials
Or files of sound, sense and shape:
Nothing for staingramdotcom,
Nothing that finds a solution. The smoke?
It chases the flies from your double
Beefburger and chips.
