<title>Cops in the Coppice
</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>The champagne quarks are popping in the particle collider
Where crystal quartz streams in buckets and quarts.
Crofts and crofters drift in the outer rings. Quoits of cigar smoke,
Clots in the lung. A corpse in the making clocks out.
Missing the crocks of gold some women work up
He conks his head on the first outcrops of sense.

That wouldn't be law enforcement officers hiding in the spinney?
What's the protuberant coxcomb, then?
The muffled coughs in the wainscot's what?
If that's the crew that jumped ship, well the coxwain's good and cross
Having to heft that hull, having to humph his own shell up the road.</text>
