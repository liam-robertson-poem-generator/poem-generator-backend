<title>God Loves A Drunk</title>

<text>Her man came off the wagon (better jump before you're pushed)
Down a flight of stairs. A fractured nut.
The surgeon warned of a character change and she said no such luck.
At the time, we thought that brave and funny.
In the boss's private ward we were whispering what
Afflicts him so? What ails him? The monitor spiked:
"Did you say ale?" Next day we found out
She'd sold the business.</text>
