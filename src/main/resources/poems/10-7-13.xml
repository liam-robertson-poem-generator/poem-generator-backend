<title>The Slave Trade</title>

<text>Strange, of all the ships
I loved the ugliest, the dredger.
On the skids, to launch it, smite its bow
With a Robertson's Golly jam-
Jar full of frog spawn.
Dug-up funfair
Cranking up its dredge
At Central Bridge. Well
The Clyde made Glasgow do it
And Glasgow made a right mess of the Clyde.
