<title>from Mandelshtam</title>
<author>Osip Mandelshtam</author>
<text>Come and we'll sit in the kitchen, us two,
Where the white kerosene smells sweet;
A sharp knife, and a loaf of bread.
Go on: you can set the stove to roasting
Or maybe gather up some twine
To tie the case shut. Before dawn
We could take a tram down to the station
Where they'd not think to look.</text>
