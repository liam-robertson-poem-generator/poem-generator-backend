<title>Typhoon Nari</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Till aa the seas, till aa the seeds are bursting at the seams,
Till water skis and waterboards at speeds beyond the schemes of man,
And heavy screes slip up and groan, screeds of foam ripped off some printer come, quickening screams,
When gutting it, don't squeeze the squid: you'll break its condom; squeamish
Scissors snip flesh. Now bin its plastic spine.
Squeals, I say, obstetric more than coital, from next door, the audience steels itself, the sneak-thieves
Seize the day as the rumbling rip tide seethes and rakes it in, all those white horses
Slaughtered, as the typhoon seals the runway, churning sleaze and gravel, filling empty sleeves and holey windsocks,
The spheres this vessel steers by as she steams through that commotion;
What salt sears, gunk smears to streams of fuel-oil.
The neighbour sneers and spears his wife again, in front of the kids, to further sprees of grunting;
Surely her spleen's going to pop? The screen's blank, the wall intact, to spare us certain scenes.
"A good sneeze", you want to tell them, "beats a bad fuck", and rush to buy them snuff. But the shops, it seems, have shut down.
The typhoon bumbles. Its little eye
Sees something beginning with nothing.</text>
