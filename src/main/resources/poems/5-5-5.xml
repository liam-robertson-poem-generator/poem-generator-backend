<text>Gravity's the barb that gaffs us to this sticky wullie.
Life would be the valve that shoves us into it.
Barb on a line, valve on a surface; what
In a volume flypes us into place? Maybe nothing,
Maybe kisses, maybe dreams.
Why, my twin-in-law, when we found a moment to embrace
Like adolescents at a family gathering,
Did my incisors braille my spouse's ear lobes?
What was the point of hiding, what the source
Of grieving, in the wings of 9 to 5?
Two figures on a classical bas relief
Where a detail shows that one is dead. In another life
The dream is not a frontier post
Where old ideas are banished and old emotions come home.
