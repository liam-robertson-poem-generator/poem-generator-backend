<title>A Golden Treasury of Multiverses</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Frailty was the initial fear: the weakest link
Might fail the chain of sense. But this was a web,
Chainmail, more like; a toil of strategies that prevailed.
Prevailed? They outstripped Napier's apocalyptic longing,
To rubble the Richter scale of Richter scales. But
Every virtuality needs a toe-hold in the vicious earth,
And every need begets a law. Here - reason, as in ration
Or perish. Some did. One web realtor took this heuristic:
Retain whatever utterance can't translate to or from English,
And every word that etymology can't reduce -
"gore", for instance"; "mardi", which isn't "Thursday".
These are the primes of language, the lauds of number.
The server - their perishable emblem - might be
A broken pier, a rig sunk in the bits it drilled for. Any
Ruin fit for haunting, any sturdy poem
To track the sun, to gauge its motor.</text>
