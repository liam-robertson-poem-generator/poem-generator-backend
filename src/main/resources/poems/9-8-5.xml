<text>Nicola's great run of dreams, when she
Was pregnant and couldn't find a flat:
There, in a draughty firestation, thinking
Curtains on the skylight, a kitchen range;
Or in an empty multistorey carpark:
A cot for the baby there, the bookcase by that ramp,
It could be nice. Where would it all have ended?
A trave for shoeing horses, God help us, a burned-out mall.
Queue three days in the rain outside a camp.</text>
