<title>The Cemetery at Koya-san
</title>

<text>Wee sweeties: white bean mash for stone babies in cap and cotton bib
Marsh gas for lanterns that twilit the way
To this archive of lamps, one for each year
That rubbed the goldfish gilt off of red-lacquered wood
To crumble under stele and cedar.</text>
