<title>Cape Sounion</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Purulent itch,
A boil - first
In the army of angels ejecting from sleep
The broil of the living, this biological brawl.
Some army; odd angels, come to that,
That bawl and clamour.
The pluke lifts clear of the surface, a hot
Bronze ball, by some accounts.
What the heck. Let's raise
A shrine to the god of the fishes.</text>
