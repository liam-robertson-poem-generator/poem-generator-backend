<title>Oranges and Lemons</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>P is for piss from drinking
Builders' tea, the tanner! Guacamolic
Mushy pea - no: plural, peas, and
Chips or cantos to your fishy
Chanties. Lodge a plea, incontinent
With the old bay leaf or lea:
Belle of Shoreditch
Is a clarty old bitch.</text>
