<text>Eclampsia. Give me some light!
The body brown and bulbous, eclipse

Of the tallow sun in the clean mud room.
Cramp, and the eyes are at maximum aperture

It's a trench, this, a camp on the Somme:
Bulls-eye for the ordnance of corporate

Crapatopia. Last time, the husband cap in hand
And the baby fished out like a carp from a pond.

This time - has he left her a dose of the clap
Before eating the pesticide he couldn't pay for?

Clasp at the dark, lady,
A last twist of silver that held up your hair -

Your molars still clamp as the next one
Takes your breast.</text>
