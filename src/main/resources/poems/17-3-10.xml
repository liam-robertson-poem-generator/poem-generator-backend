<text>The arteries are clogged, the cord is taut.
What once in clover coiled, now clawed its way
Through cogged procedure and slyly claused protocol.

In the ringing quad he'd conned
Vocabulary, coined the odd mistake
And called it art. The clod.

Many are called
But few are frozen cod,
And they don't crow.

What caused him to smart was the hushed
Chord of a lover's voice.</text>
