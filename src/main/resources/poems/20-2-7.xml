<text>Nothing loath
An orchid in a stone
She saw the look
And gathered up, with that
Tinge of green bamboo keeps,
A shift of - wouldn't it just be? - 
Green silk. A competition:
Impress me with a gift.
Some brought her gold, you know,
You name it she would loathe.
One said for you I'll kill
My son. Well that did it.
She took him on (he had no son)
And how - the rain like those
Bead curtains for a time - they
Wrestled. Ultrasound.
Home, her mouth as if
Flattened against glass.
And he's afraid. She
Sits across from him.
Sets a knife on the board.
