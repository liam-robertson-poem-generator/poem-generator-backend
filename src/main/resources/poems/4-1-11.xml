<text>The buzzard mews the kite whinnies. One cow
Moos another mows like reek
Through aa the week, and mouthes
Her part on Sunday, o, or
When the mood's on her, when it moves her to
Dance before the flat screen in her mules
And mounds of old reminders
The moon's behind her, the TV flex	
Moors it to earth. She doesn't see
The muons but who does? Perhaps the muse
Of physics.
