<title>A Song of Sixpence</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>The fanfare pealed and tinkered, a euphonious
Traffic jam, the constable-conductor looking pleased
(I'd plead on his behalf diminished
Responsibility). The cabinet queued and peed in the common
Or garden gardy-loo. The chancellor preened, unshaken
Till he peered at the looking-glass
And got quite peeved on account of its reluctance.
Some oik, perhaps, had peeled its silver back
To sell for sixpence. (The king,
By all accounts, was sixpence short.)
