<text>Canal bridges tighten the laces of its shoes
The damp ingredient in eel or stockfish or canvas stews.
Secrets of the kitchen and the court:
The duke hunts rodents with a mallet.
Great divots out of the sea turf.
At least one shrew's died of fright in the autumn showers,
Its little coat fit for a Faberg&#233; charity shop.</text>
