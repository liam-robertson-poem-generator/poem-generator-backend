<title>Church on the River Nerl 1981</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>The film is cockroach brittle, this print
Has tints of the sink it slid from,
Vitreous china sky, like my little eye,
Awash with floaters.
Yet I've spent this night firm planted
Like fishermen that day
Corkscrew drill and hip flask, hunched
Evangelists.
What I saw there was a share of perpetual light
And absent faces that
Gaze through my soul with eyes of stone.
