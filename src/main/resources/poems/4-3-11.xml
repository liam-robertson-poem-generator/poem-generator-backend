<text>The morgues are full
The air-con's out
Go park it where your mouth is.
The maws are stuffed
The malls - sold out;
Go park it. You know?
The morn's morn
You'll no can tell
What mobile mob's be-viralled
The keywords of
Your goggle search;
Cats, dolls, should I go on?
Modal arguments
(Aye, right).
A bull careers, a grizzly
Mauls; such turmoil
In the markets.
So park it.
