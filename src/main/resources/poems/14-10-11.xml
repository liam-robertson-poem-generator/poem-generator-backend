<title>Life</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>What writhes on the slide is still. The world
Simmers round it. Though it rives and rhymes itself, it's still
One utterance, the rinds of little cells incorporated
Not discarded. The vehicle it rides is sheer inertia,
Tamil bronze. It riles the planets - not so as they'd
Rise up. Or notice.
