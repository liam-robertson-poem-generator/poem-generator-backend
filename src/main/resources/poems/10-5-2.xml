<text>Ethane methane propane butane
Ethyl Methil Fife. So this would be
A snug in the East Neuk (would that be right?)
And on my left the drab would have to be Ethel,
Ethel the Tart. There's times you surface
Like a burst mains through a pavement,
And fall apart like an old stockpile of re-treads. Serves you right
For getting methylated in the first place. I'm a dab hand
At making it look like a master stroke. But what was this:
Some kind of posh ted footering with a cigarette machine
(I mean cigarettes? In a pub?)
Two bears behind him. A bit too close.
He decides he's leaving with or without his fags and squeezes past them.
One of them shouts at the back of his head
And your submarine was shite!</text>
