<text>I gowfed with the board at Carnoustie
Goosed a waitress at the 19th hole
Haw haw. We groused at Pittenthing
With the Chiseler of that Ilk, who grouched
About gormless Pictish beaters
Grouped on the sphagnum
Under a golf umbrella. Grout:
Urinal drip by drip deposited
In between his joints,
Gout and spite that came with the territory.
