<title>A CalMac boat</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>A CalMac boat will gently bump
The pier to say - we're here! Geography stops.
With all that glass being flannelled
You would think it was a telescope.
A baritone burp, the newborn baby
Deflates like a souffl&#233;
Chin propped up, the two eyes of surprise.</text>
