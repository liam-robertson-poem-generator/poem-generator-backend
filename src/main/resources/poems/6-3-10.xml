<text>If the creature's flawed, the fault is with the maker.
But when a cratur cracks, who gets the blame? I've fawned on none
But the fraud faith in an absent faither
Instilled by two fond parents who were there
Till the dice of my vertebrae straightened like a frond
In that cold wind.
Struggle with silk buttons on a frogged tunic,
And laws that flogged and goaded me, but protected her.
These kodak memories will have fobbed me off until I'm old,
Sat there drinking tea. The windscreen fogged a rainy firth
Till all the well and ill-formed movements of the heart
Reveal themselves to one no longer able to take them in: foiled again.</text>
