<text>It snorts and sorts its quills then storks around, the drone,
Prime time squats feel swat teams put the doors in
When it squawks its radio squawk and stalks
Dissent. Scots wha hae - anyone at all who wonders
How they bet your shirt and socks and OWN when they should be IN the stocks
They wouldn't exchange two five spots for the credit default swaps
They concocted. Who sops up the debt when the jingle stops?
Painters shall wear kindergarten smocks and poets rhyme,
Sloths gambol in their jungle, quick as treacle slops.
There's some go through life like a dose of salts
Some of us get a rich sauce to savour.
In actuarial terms it all slots in.</text>
