<text>Are towels tools? Trowels are.
Towers of Silence, projectors of the dead,
Could be, but tombs are not. Ming tombs,
So Moscow Subway-like, all porphyry and marble
Going nowhere in a circle, ax- and de-
Celerators of the masses in twos and threes,
With above-ground tours for towns on the periphery.</text>
