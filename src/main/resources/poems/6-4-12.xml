<title>Dumb Waiter
</title>

<text>First's instructions such as Fuck off. Off he fucks
Without a fuss, but fluffs it: back he comes. Excuse me,
What do I do? - Go away and don't come back till.
Doesn't get it. The flux of being,
The bloody flux, old bean,
Is not amenable to algorism.
Thus the robot flunkey flunks it:
Never will he butle or majordoo
The sherry-marinated pterodactyl
In Chandler. San Berdoo:
Sea fronts in summer
Rain. Auld frumps in summer
Sandals.</text>
