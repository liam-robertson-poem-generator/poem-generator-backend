<text>Its creed is a church's nave, stone keeled or wooden,
Queered and thwarted.
A source code keyed in to the mother board
Where this little routine cleared it with the government,
That one creamed off cash,
And this little bot took all the little secrets,
All the little secrets it cleaned and screened and stashed.
