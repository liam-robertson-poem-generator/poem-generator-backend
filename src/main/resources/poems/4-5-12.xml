<text>Max is the man.
He invented the mass.
He keeps his goods in masks, and yet
He marks them just in case
Some pieces of eight or pieces of ass
Show up at marts on the dark web
Lashed to cell-phone masts,
Pinned to prayer mats.
The maths of his scheme is simple:
Last in pays the plain-clothes
Men in macs. Every week, new
Maps get shaken out and tucked in.
