<title>Theism and Biscuits</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Before they took to brewing drouthy wine, the Israelites
Got tannin chewing saddle girths, and spat. There's days I wish
They'd traded jah for cha and druk pu-erh and read their tea leaves:
A man will come with scandalous good news. Don't cross him; give him
Tea and some of your granny's biscuits, hard as hockey pucks, to dook in it.
