<text>Not known, but it could be that the Naragansett
Brought us the word 'kayak' but, when they sighted
Boreray in cold eruption from the slanting deep,
That votive pyre of gannets seeking some implacable god,
Turned tail and set the outboard. Though of course, we tracked them home.
To commune with the wild is beauty. Fear
Is when it communes with you.
