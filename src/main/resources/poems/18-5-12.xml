<title>Scotland Again
</title>

<text>Donkeys wear straw hats. Deer don't
Till taxidermy, when they sprout,
By flickering hearths in lodges
With their hearts gone to the dogs,
Too many items of harris headgear. Be a burro!
the  gillie hacks two holes in your sombrero. Castanet
Sparks of static jump between your lugs in halfs and starts
To drown the signal rhetoric of fairy harps, that antlers
Received as surely as its hasps
Clutch a family bible.</text>
