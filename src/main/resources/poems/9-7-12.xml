<text>Tess is in dis-
Tress: the tex-mex
Brunch has hit the ceiling fan.
The treks were too extensive, in Bhutan,
The star tests sensitive to a fault, the texts
Inextricably tantric.
The enchilada, in centrifugal tenths
(Whoever heard of tents with ceiling fans?)
Made finger-licking tankas on the floor.
Tense times: the round is cut in twelfths, but not
Doled out. Those twerps! What were they about? The terse,
The tersest I can hazard is
I don't know: blame it on the temps.</text>
