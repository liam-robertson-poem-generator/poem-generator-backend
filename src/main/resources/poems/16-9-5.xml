<text>La petite mort, they say. Preceded by
An hour of 'flu and a minute of epilepsy.
Why would I want to take a lovely woman there?
I do. But today it's just the flu. As though I'd met my critics
(I have some now. It's rather sweet)
Without knee-pads and helmet (sorely missed),
Skiing gloves, a hockey sock and shin pad of my dad's,
The greave of a legionnaire, et caetera.
I lie here thinking 'Grieve, with a name like yours
I wouldn't change it.'
