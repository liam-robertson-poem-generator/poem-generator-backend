<title>Mills of God
</title>

<text>The windmill was my toffee apple on a stick
The scandalous got drowned with a millstone round their neck;
But what drove a watermill, why a click mill clicked,
What a pepper mill processed or a paper mill produced
I couldn't say, in the mirl of the metaphor,
In the militant glory of god
Where the men with the millstones explode
And the homicide bombers upload some deal
We're supposed to approve and applaud as a secular
Judaeo-Christian jihad (for gas)

A mill's a thing for grinding grain to powder.
What's a war for?</text>
