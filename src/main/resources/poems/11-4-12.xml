<text>Jock sucks on a soor ploom, sups up his pint and
Sulks: he's one of those sumps for bitter vibes that
skulks in his boneyard bailiwick till somebody stumps him.
Howzat! The skunks, says he, as into the crease he slumps.
On sus the Law slurps up the usual quorum. One of them smiles or rather
Smirks at the word that spurts from the Man unbidden.
She sloughs her kit. How many times today? Don't call us sluts!
We're worksuckers, fuck-swappers, insultants. Don't be scared!
Who scuffs our paintwork anyway and scrapes our little scuts if it isn't you
Whose scurf's in the pleats of our skirts?
Who stuffs ourselves - or tries - and struts away adjusting buttons?
Not us. But who, if anyone, snuffs it when you go in the strunts,
With scruffs and scrunts and pimps to do your bidding?
That's your law: one surfs, another suffers.</text>
