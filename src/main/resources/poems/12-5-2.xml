<title>My Life in Bugs and Drugs</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Infections: measles, mumps and chickenpox
Colds and flu, pneumonia
Antisocial smoking (stopped) amoebic dysentery.
Injections, intravenous, intramuscular, drops and pills:
Yellow fever tetanus polio hepatitis A hep B
Typhoid Japanese encephalitis, beer and wine
Diphtheria, whooping cough and coffee, Rabies one to three
Seasonal influenza oral rehydration salts
Increasingly unfunny antiprotozoal drugs
With recreational disinfectant chasers;
General or local shut-me-downs for this and that,
Aspirin paracetamol cortisone antibiotics
Thingmy-blockers, antihistamine tiger balm and tea.
Another jab or shot?
Why not.
