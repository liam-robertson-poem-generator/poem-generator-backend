<text>Windowlegend fan and castanets and suedette bull
Formica table, the syrup got drained into a cup
Fruit cocktail into the sponge flan with some jelly, not too soggy.
The cobra's fang was like the horn on that bull, but full of venom
You'd have to choke it with the tongs and crack it owre the heid wi the poker.</text>
