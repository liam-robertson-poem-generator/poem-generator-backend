<title>Estrangement</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Milk jug on a tray, breakfast in bed. A polythene
Chug boat in the bathtub. Paper and paint.
Potbound perennials in the front room doing time
Then ugly surgery for him and our
Unlovely adolescence.
In different ways
We all freaked out.
