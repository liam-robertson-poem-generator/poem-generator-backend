<title>After the Rout
</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Let's not lament the makars or forgotten songs, but thank
The readers in whom Henryson's survived obliteration.
I'm not falling  off the map, quite the reverse:
It's coming away like gauze, for this
Is the promised earth. Lank grasses
Assuage the lack on which the world's vanity
Draws its flickering charm. The drab skylark
Final plummet silent.</text>
