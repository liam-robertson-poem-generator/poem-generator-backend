<text>A rookery rout.
The quorum of darkness in judgment.
Pharmacological bends
In his winter and summer white wine
Till we at the requiem roust souvenirs,
That he is the root of we can't pull by planting.
The taurine voice is rooked,
His dream home isn't roofed
Yet, or bought, or the road to it
Mapped. A cosy roost.
Come and we'll sit in the kitchen.
