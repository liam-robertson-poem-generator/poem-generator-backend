<text>Don't start.
No as smart as he looks, and he doesn't
What? A wee bit saft I'd say.
A slat in the venetian blind a-
Slant there's scant sunlight
Through pigeon scat and what gets spat
On glass by Joe Bloggs, Jack Spratt, whoever.
Whatever.
You spanked the boss?
Not mine; they'd sacked me.
 - It all stacked up.
You smacked a managerial bot.
I snacked at my desk, I never slacked.
You slashed a canvas in the guest room
You splashed the guest room rest room. You got smashed
On snifters stashed for visitors.
You snatched a few for later, scratched
A maledictory message on the panelling
And left. Hatted and scarfed you left, but the gate
Was staffed by a zero-hour gorilla 
Who'd sapped my will to live.
You snapped his wrist; you slapped another one?
Not as if I'd scalped um. Self defence.
No win, no fee? The whole system scrapped.
Management strapped down and de-
Lobotomized. Prescription stamped.
The patient sat there.
