<text>Though pipped at the post the runner-up is a
Loser. Losers should expect
To be wiped out, picked off one
By one, pimped out and pricked, however
They had primped in finery prinked
With gilded studs. Their cheeks
Get pinched. Their words I will not
Print not even in legal footnote
Pitched for microscopes.
Pissed on the eve
Of someone else's battle, the penultimate Pict
Squares up to the pit.
