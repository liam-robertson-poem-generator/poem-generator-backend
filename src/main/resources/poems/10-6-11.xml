<text>Boredom he says. He says it drills
A wee hole in yr heid. No the third eye.
Aye. No. Oh he does, dizzy? Aye
And it dings down to bone and it says this is it
- Which it isny, he says, ontologickly speaking.
Dings doon the phone: disney like big words.
Wanna thae bright sunny daze;
A primrose digs itsel oot.
A bee is, like, helicoptered in,
Pinballs aroun, dizny get it; back to base.
Did you order this day? Says my boss. Ay a did;
Dim's the word, I said. Pay for it later.</text>
