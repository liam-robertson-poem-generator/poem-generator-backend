<text>She cared about him, which is why
She'd caged him in the cellar
And caned his knuckles if he craned his
Scurvy head out through the bars.
She quailed at the thought of violence
But in practice it was not so bad.
She never caved in, for what he craved,
What he was four-fifths crazed about was
Well, you know.
