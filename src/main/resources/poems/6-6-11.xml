<title>Deep Harbour (Djupviken)</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>A spray of figs on shore, she fills
Her strips of cotton sail (no frigs, no frills)
And beams at this, my face like fizz.
Shin-deep in shingle frizz, she flings
A stick. The hounds of the gale dive in,
With canine fids to try the knots of
Cold or courage in me:
Honoured fibs and firms dissolve
In flimsy bubbles. Hope, like her
And Finland, grows on granite.
