<text>The rhododendron on the green
Its heads and limbs so crimson heavy
Heaves itself out the ground,
A magician's scarf from a top-hat.
Expect a scarlet cypress by the house,
A pillar of fire on this slope to the water
Visible to the naked eye from the alpine ridge beyond.
What's that? Says one to the tother and hooks his
Line around a rock. That is the home of the
Unknown Scottish poet (howks a lump out the s&#233;rac).
And what's he like?  - hoots, how would I know?</text>
