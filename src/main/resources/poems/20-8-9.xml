<title>for Ian Colclough</title>

<text>Was it the drowning eight years later
Memorised that first attempt
At verse "Too late, he's dead!" the bosun cried;
Sorrowful silence was our reply.
I hear a swizz, a ripple, something
Awful in that latter line.
- But I've done worse since, and a good friend lies
Twenty-eight years under, as I live.</text>
