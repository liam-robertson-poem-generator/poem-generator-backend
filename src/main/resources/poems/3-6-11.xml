<title>Coming into Her Estate</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>This one, found in the back of a wardrobe,
Scuttles and pings with hat pins, gnomic prynnes
And pills for the prig's condition.
The silly besom's cracked two crystal
Prisms trying to fit them in.
Outside under the cork oak,
Worth their weight and happy as,
Ten Vandal pigs, the colour of kelp.
