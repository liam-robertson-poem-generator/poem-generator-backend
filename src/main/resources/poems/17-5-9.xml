<text>I'd have clamped my teeth tighter than it's cramped in there,
Arms clasped and coopered, though it's ME that's casked
Some Thing. Maybe. Drouth like a summer karst, I cranked out
Jokes. Crashed on the way home. Write-off. Not a cut or scratch.
I had nine lives therefore I was a cat.
Camped out on the fell, crapped out of the climb I'd planned.
Back to my clapped-out blank.
This is a sturdy craft, I say, not some cart-
Load of meretricious Murakami. More it is
Than it's cracked. Clashed with the fitba. So?
To have been capped, not cursed or carped at, out-
Classed by the players, out-quaffed by the fans, cast
Out as in cacked by the body politic.
Cashed in my chips and re-invested.
