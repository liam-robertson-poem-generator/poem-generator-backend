<title>Suffrage</title>

<text>"We Americans can do something great in November
Or we can do something absolutely terrible and then live with the shame."

The poor boy and prole are evicted, enlisted. For them
The political poll dance, the minor mazurka is done.

As I lay in the Byron Hotel,
In the lane where they shot Kapodistrias,
We were texted at sun-up: the man one.</text>
