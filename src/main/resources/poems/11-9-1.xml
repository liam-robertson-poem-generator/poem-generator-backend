<title>A rag in C
</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>The flesh is bruckle the fiend is slee
Stamp to your ankle, straight-back down
The clucking dice, the clatteran scree.
Get to the bergschrund, check your bindings,
Lean into the void and ski
The magic mountain, Sri Menakshi's
Plaster-plated ghopuram
Of toothpaste-pink, mustachioed
Cadets who, to the camera, say "spree".
Sea spray. A rag in the unlikely mode of C.
Show me a canvas and I might just see.</text>
