<text>Slight list to port. Two shots of fino
Slide down  the bar. She heeds her instinct, takes
His glass. Here's to you. Fresh air? Up on deck
He's blacking out. She bends to adjust her sling-backs
heaves him up from the shins
And over the rail. Who hears a splash?
And that gouge on her wrist, wake on an oily reach â€“
The vessel heals.
