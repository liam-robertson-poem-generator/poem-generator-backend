<text>'This species makes a network of runways on the surface of the ground amongst grass and also uses shallow tunnels.' Corbet &amp; Ovenden, The Mammals of Britain and Europe
I build runways. No,
I'm a small, wingless mammal.
I fucking run on them, that's what.
Not a mouse or a rat
Or a rodent at all: I self-identify
As a micro-ruminant. That's what.
