<text>The zit, a sebaceous eruption,
Would sit and spit cherry pits oot owre the rail.
He sipped his rich red to the silt
Then slit something. Whoops
Spilt it and slipped on it,
Split a seam, put one leg out as a stilt,
Zipped up, slicked his hair back.
Where was he? The sitcom,
A skit he would build on it,
Skipped to the pratfall,
Skimped on the build-up, scrimped
And saved nothing. The script
Was stripped to some squirt in his shirt-tails,
A skirt. Him with a squint, her
That boo-hooed and sniffed.
Then they sprint round the sofa. Such fun.
Just 'cause you're skint, just because
You got stiffed, I mean if
You make something, work till it's done.
Don't stint.
