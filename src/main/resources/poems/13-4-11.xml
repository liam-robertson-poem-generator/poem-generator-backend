<title>On the Likelihood of Life Elsewhere in the Universe</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Shrubs in the suburbs haka. Glasgow shrugs
As a hyper-squall shoves it
Through the eye of some needle.
Nobody pays the piper, but we all fall into step
As the busker shuns the wind, heads it round.
You scarce can hear, in the teeth of it, the contention of the sirens.
It's here, so how could there not be life on Mars?
