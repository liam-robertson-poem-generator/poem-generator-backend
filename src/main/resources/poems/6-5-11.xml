<text>One of the fans says, Hiy, are you the poet?
I shows my fangs and says, How, are you the fan?
He says Mibbe (thinks) and if so, I've a request.
The train (we're on one) head-butts and hyperventilates;
I reckon the driver's deid. I know
I'm out of booze and fags.
Don't insult me again, he says. It's true
That you have hard words to use
(And nothing to eat but one of their sump-fried
Flans, like chewing signal flags)
And don't be rude. Abuse has a short shelf-life.
Fads are an 18th-century thing, like novels,
But the poet farms as long as there's earth to turn.
And if I don't read you, there's nobody will.
