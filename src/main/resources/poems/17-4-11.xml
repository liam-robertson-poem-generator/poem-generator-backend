<title>Social Distancing</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Bone runnels, grips and kirns,
Curls of butter, curds and honey, crumbs
On the breadboard. Milky tea.
All those hills to climb!
The asymptotic curves to flatten!
Culls are a drag: the cringing curs,
Seal pups and bloody clubs,
When just a slice of lemon curbs the scurvy.
Cousin, there comes a time
'Faut bien mourir de quelque chose'
(We have to die of something). But
Let's not all rush at once.
