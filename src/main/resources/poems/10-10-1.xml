<text>When I said mum she died and he hit me
When he hits me I say mum and she dies
He hit me when she die and I say mum. The mushroom key
Secretsecretsecretsecretsecret. Bricabrac think
I dye the carrot blue
I dry the pilchard tin
Toilet-seat turret : a tank.
Cover every empty inch
In zero point one millimetre ink
And bless me, doctor.</text>
