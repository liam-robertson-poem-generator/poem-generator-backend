<title>Temurah

<text>S for Simon "chist" for pure
He called me stone,
Fissiparous schist.
It hit the fan, I left
The club. No, sir, I
Never seen this man.
Shrift I am. The snowfinch
Spread its cross above my head
Hrit! Hrit!
Roll a die for the word he wears;
A distant star, another hit: the seamless,
The seamless purple shift.</text>
