<text>In your mother's garden, thunder
Dribbles on the chin of a green green lemon
Splashes on the sill to waste till next time
Lodged in a greener leaf
Or till, in dim Darwinian days,
The fruit extrudes a jaw and drinks
In the sweet, astringent
Republic of branches
Where nothing is stolen and no one is lost
And use of the common tongue does not mean
Coucher avec les boches. How much
Would that one cost in Euros?
People now are in line to say
We surrender, baby, our neurosis
To constitutional click bang psychosis.
Inured to irony they swear allegiance
You seek and find a newer way to reach them
I knew your mother. And you are
Her daughter</text>
