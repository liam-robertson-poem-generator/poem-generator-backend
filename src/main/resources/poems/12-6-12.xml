<text>I've worn a rut between two gists
On the road to Compostela: home and work.
Two jiffs and it jilts me
Like the fiddler's wife a pilgrim.
Dear St Jinx, Would you gypse it for me?
As it jinks John Calvin's town of stone and chintz,
Down the Rhone,
Holy Highway 61
The sun unrolls
A silk road over the sea.
Where's my stick and scallop?
Where's my faith and freedom?</text>
