<text>A Phrygian frieze where stone-cold
Rage and fears freeze in a fridge
On a plinth, your art plugged in
On line, the battle order
Frees up. It feels
Like death, though how would I know?
Verbal ticks and fleas make what they can of it.
The colonel feeds his mount and flees on foot.
Fees and commissions mount up.
It all feeds back in a loop
Into the big picture.
