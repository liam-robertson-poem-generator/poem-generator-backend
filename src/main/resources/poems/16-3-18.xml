<text>The trees and their location made a grove
Sacred - not to the bugs whose housing schemes
Disfigured every leaf. And clearly not
To those who ground such cynipids to paste
For ink. To them the great trees were gall oaks,
As though you were known not by or for your name
But by your function in some squalid
Unembraceable economy.
Except for folk on pavements
In sopping sleeping bags, that
I have the gall (not mine) to write about.
