<title>The Ice-cream Cone Belongs to Me
</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>From a land of rancid rites
You're tired of rice in begging bowls,
Piss-poor poets and pisspot songs
So you writes to the man:
To go with the obligations, we want rights
And big-league earnings, huh? A shipwright's ransom.
Give me the free beer, you dull dumb-asses.</text>
