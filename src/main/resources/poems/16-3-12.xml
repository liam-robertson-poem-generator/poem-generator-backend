<title>At the Ironmongers</title>

<text>"A gross of six-inch nails and a gallon can of one-coat gloss,
White." The boy in the blue coat gawps. "Please." (A language problem?)
"A gross of extra-sensitive galoshes." He still gawks,
Then slumps to the counter. Sticking out of his back:
A Cheyenne arrow, suckered like a lamprey.</text>
