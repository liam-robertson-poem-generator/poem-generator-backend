<text>Seconds away, they kissed and clinched
The deal. Hair kinked and crimped, Chan
Tartan kilt, a chest of China,
Linen, quilt and cutlery. They clinked
Glasses clipped by hoboes, no,
Bohemians, shied their empties
Off a cliff. The worst man quipped about
The boxers. Then it clicked:
She hadn't quit her job, she'd
Kipped on it and got kicked out.
So all that flashy kit?
