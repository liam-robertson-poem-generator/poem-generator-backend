<text>The dogs of Thimphu run the place
Their tongues like socks hanging out of drawers
(Red socks in a blue wash, tut.)
Their pelts stretched out like so many Texas drawls
So many: the capital's been carpet-bombed with mutts
Mongrel dods of not-quite-there, their dreaming
Controls the flight of daws.
Good karma: don't imagine
It brings you back as a prince, jacuzzi
Full of compliant dolls and suchlike froth. No,
It daubs you in cheap fur on Thimphu's rustic roads
The holy mountain draws you out at dusk
Into the ululation.</text>
