<text>"After the possession of these miserable islands had been contested by France, Spain and England, they were left uninhabited"
- The Voyage of the Beagle

Jackass penguins bray.
Rock geese yawp as in Darwin's day.
Even grunts who yomp and go
Have pre- and post-synaptic neurones firing.
The land does not, remember, though
Landmines, when trod by sheep, dismember.
Which reminds me</text>
