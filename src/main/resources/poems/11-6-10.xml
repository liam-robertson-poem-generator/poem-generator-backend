<text>Quick water slid on the flush-silled strid
And spilled. The meadow swigged and swilled it
Fat to muscle slimmed and strained athwart
As two skilled oarsmen skimmed from quick
To salt to see-saw something
Devil-deep skirled ink and squirmed
A squid! A squid! My kingdom for
But bless me father I have skinned
A cat. No bless me I have fathered
Kids skid skid and even they
'll have sinned.
