<title>gauze</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>The gauze of language pulls away from empty settlements
As gods on wooden horses cram the trunk road heading north
Like too many leaf galls on a sprig of oak
That Gauls and Philistines consider sawing off, although
- Perhaps because - they're sitting on it, gobsmacked.
Gingerly, one flicks the gongs in the music room, which whisper,
And grogs in the hearth.
