<text>What was that in aid of? No one wins.
Whirrs and clicks, steam bells and whistles. Someone
Whirls it round his head and whizz: you don't need wings
To fly. But see for landing?
The whigs can claim biology and qualms
Of conscience as progress. That's all.
Evening brings the craws hame.
Judges don their wigs.
A will's read out, the heir cut off
By pre-demential whims.
The head-winds guide him.
