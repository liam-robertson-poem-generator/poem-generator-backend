<text>Flung off his coat, the stoker
And his tender all coked up
Along the coast the driver coaxed it
Owre Drumochter Pass. To the picture-house
We coursed in blackout/white-out 1941:
It's murder polis going to Inverness.
Don't court Ms Astor, Humphrey! She's the one
Your partner crossed. He croaked in the opening shot.
Don't answer every time it rings. To quote Karl Marx,
The real block-buster is its own McGuffin.
Then again, you coped; you cloaked and swaggered off
Not to the White House but to Casablanca.
Her purse with the hammered colt was handed on.
You coached the boss for a part in Chinatown.
