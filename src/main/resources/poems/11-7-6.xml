<text>No sooner had the tempest digested them
Than Prospero stopped and said
(To the rainbow, through a spider web)
Miranda! Here's Caliban crushed in a book
And Ariel, quick as click, but caught
In the self silver of a mirror server.
Myself is elf and serf, and I, the other,
Here conjure		Rough magic.</text>
