<text>Among friends or, later on,
When ferns count as company,
There's something fends for itself or tries.
In firebreak fells, though,
On watershed fens,
When the feds demand your fingerprints
Think twice.
Keep your hands where I can see them.
They don't care what you print. They want
What you secrete.
Would you please remove your hat, sir?
That's not a hat, it's a fez.
Your phlegm's the thing. So spit.
