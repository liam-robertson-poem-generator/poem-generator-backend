<text>Well it is and it isn't
Normal to get scrunched up
Through the floor,
Sloughed and coddled
Scuffed and soft
Hardly a gristle strut to your name
If any.
And then you're 
Stuffed in woollies. Really!
Surfed the breast,
You sucked and slurped the magic
Toggle and slumped
Consummate drunk
Till opening time and supped again.
Killing time you smirked and sulked.
Where is that slut? Ill manners
Come with culture,
Go with the scut of fear. Keep going
Till you're stumped
A duster snuffed.
