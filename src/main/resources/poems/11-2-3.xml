<text>Pious hopes of poets
Carved in glyphs on bars of
Soap the polis issues every
Month or two, the doppler pulse, as we
Whizz down the slope, backs up
Its spoke to the hub,
The indecent keek-hole, the panopticon.
You poke at the gourmet grub, you
Cope with government hocus-pocus. A scope,
In all of this, is not a purpose.
