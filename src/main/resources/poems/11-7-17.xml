<text>Douglas the grey
Dandelion wraiths
Of tethered  smoke
Look
The slow
Mosquito spiral
Unravels
Africa
In memory
In me.

I've eaten bread and olives
Here for you for me
Drunk one of those
Well-marketed, indifferent beers
The garden's drunk on thunder.
Just a sec..

Excuse me, but
To think of that
Dumb zek
His grasping poetry
And you the radical
Exile and dissenter.
Happy man!

The temperate lilac bush
Beckons grey
And purple of thunder.
A bead curtain held aside
On a place of delicate sounds and scents
For you. Who'll light your way
To the land of the blind.</text>
