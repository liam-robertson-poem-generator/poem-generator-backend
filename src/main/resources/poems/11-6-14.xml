<text>It's a sin. But then what isn't?
it's a cinch, a slam-dunk case.
We went in hard. You know the rest.
A squinch? Now that would be
Masonic squaring of the circle,
'trompe' in French. A trumpery.
But don't change the subject.
Beetles in the wrong place
As the keystone
Found its slot: we squish them.
Swish of curtain ring on rail, and look:
The place is empty. All that
Sacrifice. Now you
Were going to grant me a wish.
