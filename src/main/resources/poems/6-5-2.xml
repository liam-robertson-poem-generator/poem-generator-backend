<text>I'm burning the Xmas flab in thinking through
What Ed said: it's the wrong folks
Are having babies, driving down the general IQ.
Surely it's more that high IQs
Are going to the wrong folks? Or even
That high IQ's the problem:
What's the cleverest species? And which one
Is focusing the blowlamp on the little rubber pipe?
Pour another shot or two of that fab-
ulous, liquid crystal, fire-blue Oaxacan hootch.</text>
