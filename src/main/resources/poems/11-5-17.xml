<text>The smack of burning flesh unfurled
The stack of sandbags dwindled.
How we stank!
And that lang swack o watter,
Slack-jawed and still in his livery
Sank without flotsam.
Visitors snack in the engines
The sac that fuelled our malice is lanced.
Now seduction is stark as a writ.
You want someone to sack.</text>
