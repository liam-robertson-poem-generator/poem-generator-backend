<text>2/3 of what you need or want
Is owned by nine gazillionaires. Their names:
Sugar-cane, Sugar-beet, Soybean and Palm-oil fruit,
Maize and Cassava, Rice, Wheat and Potato.
Soon there will be seven, each
Controlling one of the seven remaining
Specimens of drone.
And all of them competing for your shite.
