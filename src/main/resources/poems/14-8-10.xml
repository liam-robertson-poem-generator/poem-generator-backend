<text>It rained on the paddocks, the paddies and lazybeds. They
Railed against their betters, raised their kids against the taxes and got on with it.
I reigned supreme, a dry
Martini in the sceptre hand
Rippled as my generals
Raged at their subordinates, who raved with less
Conviction at the cavalry, unruffled,
That reined aside and ranged so wide and far
They had to stage the occasional raid to augment their rations.</text>
