<text>"Tvoim uzkim plecham..." - Mandelshtam

Hear no evil spilled the beans and speak
No evil nodded till it hurt
See no evil plays a Keystone Cop
In Cheka leather with a riding crop
To punish bedbugs on some slender back.

Snow melts away but "manuscripts don't burn"
They haunt the lots like trash from Tetrapak.
That cruel clip the poet didn't show
Was lifted from "La Religieuse". No blame
No blushes: Diderot. Just turn it off.</text>
