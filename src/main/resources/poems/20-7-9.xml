<text>When I let her go
She leapt out the window
(Ground floor, stage left
In a cloud of dust), though in my head
I'd given her up for lent not lost
But lest I meant by that some kind of
Lending library deal, I guess,
She beat it pronto, permanenter. Me,
I leant against the window sash and sang
A blues of course.
