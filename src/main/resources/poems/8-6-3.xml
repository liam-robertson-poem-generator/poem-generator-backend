<text>But shouldn't it start from nothing, not from words?
It does: they talk to me
Then they shut up and we all listen -
Well, most of us. Loose talk cost the lives of pagan gods
Sunlight spelunking, looking for a human bud to nip.
They're no great loss. Unless they've taken realms of silence with them,
Sequestering almost all but the name of poet.
