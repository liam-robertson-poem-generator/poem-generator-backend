<text>Ad te suspiramus, gementes et flentes in hac lacrimarum valle

The Holy Ghost was a baldy man like Mr Lynn, the electrician
Radio broadcasts snagged like wool in brambles, fog condensing,
Or pearls in the trawl of Spanish lace my mother wore to mass.
That was a mantilla - it was not the veil of tears
From which Totheedowe sent up our sighs, mourning and weeping.
It's not what you know, it's who you know
My mother's mother said, with such disgust
We knew what she meant, though not who she meant.
I know now. I know them now. And their sticky networks.
The vale of tears was the World, the veil of Maya
And every salty drop of it is wiped away.</text>
