<text>Poor swan: cold eggs and a flotsam nest
It lolled to build again, too close
To the reservoir. The razor wire
Was sung through by the wind, that tore
The tear gas from protesters who were taking a quiet burger
Joint. Complaints were lodged on reinforced
Concrete bricks and lobbed at folk brought there
For that, who hadn't logged the far rainforest;
They longed, it's true, to kiss their teak
Night sticks goodbye, live off the land
And pension funds dependent on flotation
Of jetsam from the Yanomani nation.
It doesn't matter, laud the lord above:
the Heads of State sing All you Need is Love.</text>
