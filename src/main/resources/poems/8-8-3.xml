<text>To coil and skewer a tress
They hoist their elbows
That lift the shirt across their ribs
Whilst at their nape
There's always little spiricles escape
And however fine and finely canted are
The muscles of the neck - in males as well -
The vertebrae, like an ancient motorway,
Snake into a cave at the base of the skull.
