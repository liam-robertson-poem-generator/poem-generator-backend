<title>H2O

<text>Burning like hydrogen
blooming like gorse in a hollow, the burst
from Aber fall-pool charges the slopes
and sounds
from boulders grinding
and deeper than bones' resounding burden
of the press and turn of water
to shivers of spray in the thorn tree
standing there like broken slate
with a liverwort crust that
gleams like galena
and each thorn glancing
with refracted fire.</text>
