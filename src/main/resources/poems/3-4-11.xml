<text>Routine pugs the lip of watering holes that star the desert
Something purrs and backtracks on a pond that purls in nothing
Purple plums, violet bloom, mist on a glass, must in the bottle
A regular plugs a pub's last barrel with his liver
Puns and quarterquibbles aren't what the poem's for
But your immense, meticulous dislocation of the senses
Is death, that didn't need your help.</text>
