<text>I'm a hag-ridden nag - or could I be the nightmare itself?
Let's say the former: get up every evening to race,
More quarantine gurney than horse,
negotiate damaged goods the receding
System's put my way but don't win clear
To the dappled charge, to career across the land bridge.
Otherwise, a bureaucrat
To test your wit and tax your strength. So
Go and have a swim, it'll do you good.
There's three old ladies peching to stay afloat
And a woman in her 20s whose husband will be at work.
Go on. Wake up.</text>
