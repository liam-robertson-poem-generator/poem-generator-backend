<text>My word - a cad at the dispatch box
A junk bond cadged for a cancelled goolie-chit
Off a broker canned for indiscretion who
When it clanged on him, thought (well he WOULD do)
Why me? My word, no sooner calved off of white noise
Than it's carved in nice distinctions,
One card, in a deck, in a drawer.
It gets coined and crammed
Under the tongue, clammed up
Until, clad in its owner,
Who'll have calmed down and out,
It means whatever you want.
