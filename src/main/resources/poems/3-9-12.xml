<title>I am Fed Up with Beautiful Women
</title>

<text>Gravity (patiently) pleats
The jungles. Burning peats
Relate their ancient summers
Incoherently.
This piece will not fare better.

There is nothing nonchalant about you.
Brightness older than the hills
Flares up in you,
And you don't quite get it.

No peace between why not
And why. You hold my glance
And pierce the routine. It's time
To go. How grey the fierce
Feast has made me.

What peaks, what stars, what beauties
Will just have to do without me.
Commit this to verse,
It's a car-crusher requiem.</text>
