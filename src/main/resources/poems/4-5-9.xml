<text>On a judo mat in splats of sweat
He's marked out the crimectomy
His sparring partner's matched with fifties facts
And in they march, un-
marked by the bull mart: wolves
Inasmuch as wolves and bikers march
(Put whatever gloss you like on matt).
one flag comes down, another
sidles up the mast. Who was
that masked man?
Sanction busters maxed out
On crude. Manoeuvres.
Massed on frontiers. Tell me
Months from now for this
The bloodlands don't get pulped and mashed again.
