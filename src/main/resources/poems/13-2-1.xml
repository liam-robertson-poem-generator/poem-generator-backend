<text>In the 50s, early 20s, Aunty Margaret
Motoring in the Borders. Funny smell.
Opens the bonnet and the manual.
Nothing obvious, old bit of rubber,
Puts it in the glove box.
Car won't start. She freewheels
Down the hill, and there's a garage.
Mechanic looks. She asks him what's up.
It's your fan belt.
		Yes?
You huvnae got wan.
			Oh!
(She goes to show him) Is that it?
Aye,
But it's no whaur it's usually kept.
