<text>A wad of greens in each ear
A plug of twenties chewing in his cheek
Walled in, he warred abroad.
Time is linear but the line is whorled.
Then again it breaks. I warned him
(Read my lips). He
had that look of something
warmed once too often in the microwave.
In the private ward
They heard all about his magic wand.
