<text>Emerging from the amniotic daze in certain senses
She drains the air or tries again and again
Then turns to pillaging the milky dales and dreaming of them.
Her eyes stop shedding light and she negotiates the chequerboard
Where he dares to ask and she deigns to reply.
That dragonfly alights on a flowering frail like a touch on a chesspiece
In joy or concentration. Is it her?</text>
