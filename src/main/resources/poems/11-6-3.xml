<text>Everything you apprehend
Is a prisoner made to strip
And be
A given sign
In a given cell.
Sip and hold
In tongue and palate
Skip the talk
And skimp on thinking
Till it sink in.
Leafs'll scrimp
The rain. They won't let dab,
They won't let slip. Till
A casual snip or the careful
Scrip of drapers shears
Cut to fit. Cut you to fit.</text>
