<text>One aborts or rapes and stones its women
A second flogs and hangs them for converting to a third
Whose holy nuns so loathe the lovechild that
Eight hundred little corpses are dumped in a septic tank.
The word and the bourn and the blackbird's song.
Exonerated - the burden being love - 
Borne out on a burning updraught
Could it all be redeemed? Could time
Skin, brain and bone the cussed structures?
The word and the bourn and the blackbird's song.
An interdict: the drum unstruck
The fossil flute not blown, no bound or sentence.
Birdsong and silence.
