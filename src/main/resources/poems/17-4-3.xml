<title>Self-Portrait in a Hotel Mirror
</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>The brows of a raptor
But not the beak
Black pupils and nostrils
Grey and amber in the eyes and teeth and hair
(A clump in either ear)
Baby skin crumpled,
Folded, drawn around the lids
Vertical pleats on a clean jaw, seven
Furrows on the forehead
Thick neck, a good slant to the shoulders.
That teacup is grey and empty now
While I'm on the cusp
In the curl of the morning</text>
