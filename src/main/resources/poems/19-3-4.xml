<text>Business class is brilliant. It's like being in a pram.
Toddle up to the front of the queue, you get tucked in.
A lady checks your buckle's fastened. Just like your mum
She gives you sweeties, she gives you toys.
If you frown she knows your name, she says what's wrong?
I never travelled first. Must be even better:
The total prenatal experience, warm
Snug to yourself.
Get what you want before you even think.
