<text>One of the points pops, and out plops
Something sebaceous. Random
Pocks, or so they seem,
Till one of the profs, on a surreptitious
Snapshot plots the complukations
Whose maker would pumice or ponce them away.
Pots of cold cream on throbbing prompts.
The pains and the pomps,
The ineffable longing.
