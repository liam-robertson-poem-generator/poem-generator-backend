<text>If the girl at the checkout
So sweet and thirty-five or so
Is a pawn in a game
The defence is patient. Siberian.
Frozen items imperceptibly
Pong when they're picked up.
Now the prong of attack :
A well-heeled customer
Some doll with matching cell phone
Deploys her goods and pays
With no time for the soft promotional porn
Or one who meekly checks her out :
Talking to that
Frozen king prawn clamped to her chops.</text>
