<title>Manhattan</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Bushy smoke-blond halo mussed
On a Japanese cartoon madonna -
One of those quantum states:
All energy's accounted for
But not all the accounts are.
The sun must float. The rest
As a purblind mutt will come to must;
The people that lives on darkness
Has put out the light.</text>
