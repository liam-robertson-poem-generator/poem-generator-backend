<title>Goldilocks (for Beverley)</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>At the end of the road - a door you don't want to open.
Pivot.
A trapdoor; the road runs up a backdrop.
Tiptoe to the prompter's box, slip in:
You're there, above the pit.
The folio says gehenna, annihilation.
You tilt it and your head to see what's scribbled in the margin.
Another roll. Your road negotiates a ledge;
That door's a shuttered window in a wooden hut with a stone hearth.
Clamber in and sleep till you wake in the feather bed.</text>
