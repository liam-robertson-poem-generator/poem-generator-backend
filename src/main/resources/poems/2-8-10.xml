<text>A braid of water
Bared rock where the dell
Bathed in glacier milk,
Big toe stuck in the tap,
Bailed out. Steep,
The reaper's blade still worked;
he baled lucerne and bellflowers.
He'd have brained
Wolves that bayed by night at signs,
The donkey, twixt two ricks of hay,
That brayed by day. It's
Well seen he was grim. So much
For a game of sodjers. Really:
It rained on his braised brisket
Once too much. He raved and
Frothed at the gob. Blazed
Hotter than his barbecue,
Which he lamed,
Kicking a leg off.
Blared about r&#233;gime change
Wait a bit, though: he IS
R&#233;gime. So raised his game,
Braved his maker,
Lazed in shade all summer
Let things live a bit and blamed
That self-compiling palimpsest,
The laird.
