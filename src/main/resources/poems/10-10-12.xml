<title>Shipley
</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>In drystane crannies snowflakes flock
and sheep with stain of moss and stone
on snowy fells.
Ice makes dice from dalebones.
Shivered whins are fivestanes
the sky plays.
It rocks stones,
collapses crouching arches,
in rage attacks the stellar slide
within stone,
and rugs at baffled, battled hearts.</text>
