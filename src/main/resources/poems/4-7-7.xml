<title>Collateral (for Chris McCabe)</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>From The Port (Port Glasgow) to the Fragrant Port
(Hong Kong) we run, and back to Liverpool
With Chinese cash for Indian opium
As Hong Kong's Finest pepper-sprays umbrellas
Among blocks that, for a moment, coincide
With a 3-D chart of the pussy-grabber's chances
Tonight.
In a Hollywood Road antique shop I pick up
A Han dancer, then set him down real slow
When I see the string of zeroes on the price tag;
It is pre-Christian. Would we be post?
I could see you lead me out the shop, explaining
'There's meth in his oddness, madam.' She is fey,
But not fatale, by the way, miss mystery;
Another bard that likes her cover deep.
Are we the infiltrators? With the twist,
On the Boston remake of the Kowloon film,
That we don't remember who we're working for.
You Tony Leung, no longer 'In The Mood', me
Martin Sheen, about to demonstrate
That vertigo, like paranoia, can have a point.
We come out well but not, I fear, alive.
