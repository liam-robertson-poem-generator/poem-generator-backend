<text>Oh Wattie! Tango wabster wove
And thirsty tongue to palate clove.
The wabster wove, the preacher practised,
A warld birrelled on its axis.
Unravel, dehisce and decline.
Is there a second chance? Ask Scotty.
The keel was a shuttle on no loom.
Slack, dehiscent foam. Knots and frames,
Knots and frames, and nothing
Wove its overmastering ephemera.
