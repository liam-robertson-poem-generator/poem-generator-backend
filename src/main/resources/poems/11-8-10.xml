<text>We spayed and gelded gift-horse. Spared the odd one. Sprayed the dapple black for luck, though it still sprained a fetlock: couldn't hack the coke.
Careless boys stayed and stared at one who strayed too far from school: dressed in motley he whipped and strained to cox the muscle-boat.
	Staid and strait-laced, whale-bone staved, indeed, with betel-stained teeth and Ascot hats, they snared the punters.
	A spade it was that saved him: one of the jockeys scaled the watch-tower, clocked him on the flap of his Russian hat. It was kids with knives that scared him.
	The captain swayed his purchase slaved over a gimbaled stove. They sailed away to Arabi-aye-ay with a load of horse and jockeys. Somebody squared it all with customs.
