<text>Beardy Brahms might just be
Tattering the kip with Mrs
Robert Schumann, tickled at a
Quip on horns in a string quartet.

Robert composes revenge in two movements:
A clip on the lug and a flintlock duet,
Or maybe a fantasy: press-gang the rival,
Bob walking off with a smirk on his coupon
And crimpage in his pocket - crisp,
Silvery notes, legal tender in Bedlam.</text>
