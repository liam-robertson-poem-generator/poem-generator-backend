<text>I was there with the Shahs of Shiraz
With the shamans and shams of Siberia
Sat on their red rugs and shags
In the red rubble shards of the high road.

Just one of the cup bearers hadn't attracted their ribaldry;
Such beauty and force: how could they not have noticed at all?
I lifted a glass. She approached, and I covered its rim.
Would you do me a favour? She waited. Stay just as you are

For ever. She looked. The rest of the scene disappeared:
Society, sex, the red carpet, my language and bearing.
For ever, she said, in your memory. Turned on her heel.
Now I'm tired of this tankard that brims as soon as I drain it
