<text>Someone has sold the weights from the clock
So women work till the men are done.
Waifs and strays are goods and chattels, offshored
To the king of the counting house, who wastes and wants
Your sixpenny serf who only stands and waits â€“ 
Even the one whose nose is gone. She wakes,
Her waist's a little thicker.
Must be all that bread and honey.
