<title>Easter Island

<text>Rat alighted at landfall.
The combers, at nightfall,
Had carried the raft shoulder-high,
As it seemed, to the shore, where the rant
Of the mutineers' shaman, the rapt
Inattention of crew as he rapped on the
Poop or the pulpit and wrapped up his sermon
Was the last Rattus rattus and Homo sap. sap.
Had to do with each other
Till every shell that ramped in sacred shallows,
Every bird or beast that ranked between them on the menu
Had a barter value asymptotic with extinction.
How can I put it? You ratched up the idols and raxed for a dugout
But I'd used the last tree to cook lunch. It was good:
Your mother's flesh sticks between my teeth.</text>
