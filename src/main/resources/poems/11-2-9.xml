<text>A sourcerer sourced the ingredients by appointment;
The boys bought stuff in a shop. The needy
Support the posh, who sell it back to them.
So it goes. You spoiled the ballot tender and sloped off.
But things do change: some chitinous feelers went wi-fi,
And there was light the critters scoped and got to flee.
Tran made room for sport; the gods had fun:
One soaped the shirts he'd soaked in a big tin
Basin, the range stoked up, to stoat them off the washboard;
One, discretely soaped, soaked in a pool that all but
Smoked on the snowy ledge. The beauty of the landscape
Smote her brow. A weasel collar
Stroked her cheek.</text>
