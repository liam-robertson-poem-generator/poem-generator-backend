<title>Nocturne in B flat Minor</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Encre de Chine, India ink
Three smokestacks do invisible
Letters home.
No moonbeam runs that Chaplin
Deck-chair foldage routine, on
This temple floor of an afterdeck.
Through indigo silk-
en time her little face
Unbuckles to the sulky sky.
Those Saigon tars on the mess deck smoke
Slick opium. The Marseilles soap
Sits pungent in its paper frock.
Conclusions settle
Brine on her lip . . .
	Am I the only one leaving
Indochina? Well she might have wondered
Till the pianist came on shift
And loosened up - a touch
Anachronistically - with Autumn Leaves
Then, pending requests for that tune by the Duke
(Did ever you see that baby dance?)
He summed the situation up with Chopin
which caught her wrist
as a Geiger counter draws the user
closer to the source.
	She's crying now
Magic salt cruet
Lost by that silly boy
In the bed of the sea.
