<title>Gloom
</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>If I can deal with the angry, maybe the sad will let me be.
If I stay under the water, maybe the smoke will let me breathe.
A snorkel lum? I don't think so.

That anger's got to go -
The angry man, the angry manner;
Especially in the right.

So cultivate the sanguine and phlegmatic
Power and knowledge commensurate
A double tulip drunk on rain.</text>
