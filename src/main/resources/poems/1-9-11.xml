<text>A lot of white cats are blind. This one
Appears to have no eyes. Scratched out?
It cowered at my approach. I said
Don't worry, cat, don't fret,
And strode on past. It belted after me.
I hear the sunrise, eels in puddles,
Icicles on wooden eaves above them: this is good.
The ease with which the ears accept
The lost causality of rhyme
Is not. I wait</text>
