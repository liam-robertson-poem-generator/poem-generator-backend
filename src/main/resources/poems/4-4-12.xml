<text>Thunder muffs another catch.
Mumps or something's stopped the pigeons chanting.
Bushes muss the roots of the rain
That mucks out gullies in a slow
Replay of lightning, where monks in curraghs,
For example, could see the world approach them,
Them and their Irish wolfhound mutts,
On a wave of light.</text>
