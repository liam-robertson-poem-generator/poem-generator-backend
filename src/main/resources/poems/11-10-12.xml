<text>First-person shooter snipes from his hide hits nothing.
Madame, though, when she smites, he's smitten.
Swipes his card and skites, as in shoots the craw.
He skypes her number, nothing. Which strikes him as odd, shouldn' t.
Spikes in her hair now, she's one of those sprites.
On some derivative sites and shows they'd splice a tail and
Salamander stripes. But she's the spice,
The spikenard. Spite's not her thing - his maybe.
He'll slice an onion paper thin and read
The world through that Book of Sights,
Foxed as it is with real and imagined slights.
