<title>Campaign for Real
</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Bellatrix in LCD, a pebble in braille
From the island that recurs to me
On its own recondite orbit. In my mind
The word real that derives from the Latin word for thing,
The cortisone that will not let me drift,
A missing line that will not let me be.

Go grind some arabica; scorch it on the skillet.
Watch the indigo dust on  the valley turn like a flock of birds
Real rose.</text>
