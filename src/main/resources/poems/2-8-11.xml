<text>There's this:
Weans or bairns or babes in the digital
Would get floated on the net bares all; if Goldilocks
Survives
It's thanks to plantigrade forebearance.
Green baize
As for snooker, red blaise as in red
Gravel tennis court under your skin. Grow up
Or try,
In fear of the book that blames and gangland blades.
Sophia
Bathes in the world. Sunken bays
Ripple out from her knees. A bloodhound bays;
Just don't
Get caught in the braes where she is.
Dawn brailles,
Monks mumble, brass brays. The gong,
No audible attack, still fills your head.
Strike back
With a shinbane whistle.
Ach
Braids of brains and bladderwrack blains,
That's what skulls are full of.
Trepan:
It's only THIS that bails them out.
Really
The last bale's sold to the trapper
As we braise the penultimate buffalo
I see
The braves were not so wise.
C'mon, Sophie:
Blaze out for us when the ocean blares.
The wise are not so brave.
