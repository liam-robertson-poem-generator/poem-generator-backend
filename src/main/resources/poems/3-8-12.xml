<text>Papes and other blighters scoffing haddock or plaice and chips
It being Friday. There's aye one shouting the odds
Another mutters and prates full time, his pate's
Away with it. The foreman plater plates and having
Had his chips clocks in to wife and weans, the weeest
Being my dad. Somewhere in Renfrew. All gone.
Who paints the woodwork? Does anyone lodge complaints
About the bigots? I'd have thought not.
The plates I guess are delft; I mind
That word from way back. How did the place
Smell? Hard work and prayer? Or reeking damp?
Pace yourselves, people: hard times ahead.
