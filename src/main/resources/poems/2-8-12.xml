<text>We share a house, a home, a base. I do
This walking bass routine to work.
The breaks are partly planned and
Partly not the kind of thing
Goes through my mind as - brakes!
The car's a curling stone. Brace.
Beside the borehole
Someone baits a hook and pats the hipflask
Where winter bakes the river hard
And bastes the ice with snow.</text>
