<text>Off piste on an active cone
That had pierced the bio
And peaked at 2-3 thousand
As dawn peeped the rim.
Up through a peat hag,
Soggy archive that will pleat and fold away
But can't retrieve, much less, by
Peeking at the answers, understand
Its ancient forest; some bog-Latin monk
Filing jerky strips of Aeschylus neither
He nor his order could or would have pieced together.
