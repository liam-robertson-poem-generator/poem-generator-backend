<text>The neighbour of my daughter's friend,
The boss's boss, the high point
Of our family trip to New York,
All torn apart, and none of it friendly fire.
Thanks to a second mortgage, Uncle Spam got a bigger,
Firmer dick, and lots of hot teen poon to point it at.
Brer Rabbit lies in his own plush and placenta.</text>
