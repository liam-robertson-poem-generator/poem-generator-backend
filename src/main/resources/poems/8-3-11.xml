<text>Two tufty knobs of wax in buckled jamjar lids that lost the thread
To the pressure of thermodynamic noise just
Under knolls of cartilage.
Light gnaws at silence. Every mind, every forest,
Every universe, for all I know - abandoned soon or late,
Norms and standards with them
Like a comb with just too many broken nogs.
