<title>Sculpt</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>He roomed in slums. Rude to landlords,
Rowed about damp and deposits.
Should have been a steeplechaser
Groomed for use and proud of it, spurred
And rowelled, never rued the race,
Or mibbe a wolf. A wolf to climb the winter
Rungs of hunger. Ruined, burning protein
Till the kill. But what beast was ruled and roused
Like him, by clay to shape round and cut square?
