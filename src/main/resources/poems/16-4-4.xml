<poem>
<title>A 1988 Volkswagen Golf</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Amalgam grey car
Dunted and dented
As space station Mir
Limoes steered clear of you
Last of the kind
A good plumber could fix
What passengers out of touch
Beyond protection
One glum, careful owner
Has sold you for scrap
Gum in the socket
Swing low</text>
