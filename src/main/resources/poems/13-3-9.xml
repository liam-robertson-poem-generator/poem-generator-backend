<text>I'm the man that putts the shot on your packet of porridge oats.
Just tuck it under your chin like a fiddle, and wheech!
It's like trying to shuck your shadow or your conscience: it stays put,
It's you that steps away, a bit short of breath,
A bit shocked at how hard it was or just how easy.
So there you are in orbit, all your money spent, shopped out
And somebody's shroffed the metal where it lay.
