<title>Busking
</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>On some kind of xylophone yards and yards long
Like playing a stretch of the Capetown to Salisbury railway on its teak sleepers
And all the trains that had thundered over the fishplates
And all the folk who looked out from those trains, rapt,
Listening, lost.</text>
