<text>A kettle was cursing on the hob
My brother was removing shin bark
From the hobnails on his football boots
In case the opposing centre-half
Demanded forensic tests.
Scrimshaw! he snapped. Boondoggle!
I was wrapped up in my hobby -
Another replica from
The Clyde Model Dockyard -
Look who's talking, I said,
And regretted it instantly.</text>
