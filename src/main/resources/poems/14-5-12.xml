<title>Rasse
</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Racks and ranks of creels
Containing rats or civet cats of some kind.

Rafts of such repositories,
Sampan towns of blocks of flats up there,

Where raffs of rain slant the streets
And rhythm rants on windows.

Those syllabaries tethered in the cross-talk
Ride at anchor. Metal rasps

As the ramps of ro-ro ferries
Shut. The little creatures rax and yawn.</text>
