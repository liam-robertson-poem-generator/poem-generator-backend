<text>By my thristly baws, by the wind that blaws and the laws that bend it!
Buoys will snap their mooring when it rises,
Garbage bobs or sinks to the blobs of sea anemone.
Boys ashore kick balls. Their more sophisticated brawls
Mark digital coordinates with bombs.
Bogs erupt, blogs abound. That immolated bonze,
Bawls and howls redacted, liquid boils and solid broils
I don't know. War bonds, there's a thing.
War blondes too. It's not the bronze
Or golden age. The brazen.
