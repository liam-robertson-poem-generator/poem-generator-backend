<text>Fluked in a fishtail gown, she flounced
Toward the dais through the frowst and crush.
Not one to flout her foresight, she
Put one foot on the bottom step
And found the stitching stopped her.
Wasn't that just the glac&#233; fruit
To top a fount of Chantilly cream?
And would one of those gigolos leave his
Champagne flute and help her up?
