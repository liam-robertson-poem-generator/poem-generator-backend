<text>All of a sud
The dove-grey tempera
Smudged on her eyelid palette
Landward she surged
Now listen, Spud:
All of a sud
The J-cloth squirmed under knuckles that stubbed it
Scrubbed and sponged till letters
Smudged and surd, till readers slurred and lost it.
The waters sunned themselves. An oarsman, pacific
Swordsman, sculled across them. That's
As fair as it gets. 		I snubbed him.
Didn't deign. 	He said, Listen, Spud:
Your Botticelli rerun's a load of pish.
Now there's a shame: you'd got quite poetic
For a critic. 	Cut it; listen:
How many a stud of young men
Slugged it out, strummed under
Balconies, who now scratch on the porch -  
Not men, but badly stubbed-out cigarettes. I'm one.
The itch remains, is all.
				But it's not that.
The notion that some power slummed it
For our benefit - Sophia by the pyramids, in the scud,
For Solovyov - may be reduced to
A tremor in the vision of a solipsist. But
What stunned and troubled and provoked him is not mortal.
Someone at the sales tries and discards a dozen things
Then smiles at the assistant: I'll have this one.
