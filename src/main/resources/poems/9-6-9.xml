<text>'A dry yin wi a twist for him, a dirty wan for me.' Another tryst
Another glass to see him through. 'Hereâ€™s tae us!' Feckless twit
And useless tit tricked out in Pictish duds. Here's tae us. Still
Their nicotine tint, the spirit-level tilt to their cups was clear
To the barman, whose cockroach whiskers twitched;
That couple ticked the boxes: place a call.
They tripped out. Never settled. Tipped like toffs.
