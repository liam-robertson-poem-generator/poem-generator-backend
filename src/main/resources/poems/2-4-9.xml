<text>Headgear like a water butt
On a cantilevered alabaster bust
Or was it a granite bust sunk in a water butt?
A chest that would bunt and swell
Like a sail or a puffball, bumped in a box
To get chomped and burped; better burked and pickled
Better burnt, but not by air-burst ordnance.
Here, let's get, to a safer neighbourhood, bussed.
The brunt was duly bucked. You busked on trams,
Brunched on garbage, bunched your fists,
Brushed your teeth, bunked in bunkers, bulked
In blinkers. Never blushed at the columnist's
Blunt words on the migrant question.
Never bluffed or buffed your act,
You'd just blurt it out.
You had no finesse at all.
