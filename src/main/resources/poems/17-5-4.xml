<text>The cam imparts an animal bob to the machine
And from the noonday calm, each vine
Will draw its own conclusion, each last
Sound will draw the full heat of the sun,
All a cram of self, a clam of death,
But nothing known: so near to am and om-
Ega it's a qualm in the deep,
A shiver in the chasm.</text>
