<text>Ten years ago to the night, we came
On a one-way  ticket and a two-year contract,
With a little girl, a little cash and a Christmas crib.
Does the woman through the wall from that
First, furnished flat still cry all night?
Does the transvestite who beat his dog
Have regular fistfights with the neighbour?
Will his pal still call the police? My embourgeoisement
Complete, I've no nostalgia for the womb,
But I think it's time we left the incubator.</text>
