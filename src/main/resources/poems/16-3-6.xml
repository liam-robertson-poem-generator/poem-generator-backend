<title>The Reverend Uncle</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Eighteen is not a theological number:
It's seven sacraments times the three
Persons, less the Trinity - id est nothing.
The rough, not roughage, isn't purgative,
The fairway neither paradise nor primrose
Path to the sandy pit. His nephew
Is equally clueless with cruets and woods,
So let's admit the caddy IS an acolyte
And that - so hotly denied it's likely true -
His bowling parishioner's right arm
As he genuflects moves stiffly back.
Does HE, though, clasping the crafted stem,
Bowed intent on that little white diameter,
Think of mass? Unlikely. If he ever did
He'd put it, like this, aside without a grimace
And go on to concede his old pal Paddy Tierney
A two-inch putt for par.</text>
