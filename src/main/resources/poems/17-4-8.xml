<title>Golden Apples

<text>"This'll nip", said Doctor Curran.
He was a currant without the stalk,
A sort of wine gum.
The colonels sat in Corinth drinking retsina till Sunday
When a dab of purple iodine bit like a javelin.
The doctor had got my mum and dad an ottoman (spell that "autumn")
Where blankets and candlewicks slept from the show of presents till the frost.

Pagan and protestant clung to their beliefs in kirn and kirk
While I was minting myth like chocolate pennies:
Up from the pier in Rothesay, I came across one of the Paisley Hugheses
And told him I'd just sailed across the Atalantic
O'Keane (attaboy! Atalanta!).</text>
