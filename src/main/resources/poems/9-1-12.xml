<text>'Trounce' is with the heel of the hand
To push the others' occiput down to chest height.
I lay and thought, so that's what men have nipples for !
And these two would be Romula and Rema -
Me the wolf ? What dimpled arms you have !
What tawny crowns ! Truce, truce!
A pleasant frieze for Khajurao temple, but not
A subject that you'd see embossed
On the tail of a Roman coin.
