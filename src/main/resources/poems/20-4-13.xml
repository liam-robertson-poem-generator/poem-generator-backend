<title>DWEM Wedding</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>The trouble is I plug my nose to sneeze
(I'm learning manners) and
My lung (the one that's left) comes out
My lug (the right one); time
Perhaps for a cochlear implant in
The spare, so when I take the lunge
I mean the plunge in church, and leave
My trusty crutch to cling, I know
When down the aisle to lurch and when to say
I do.
