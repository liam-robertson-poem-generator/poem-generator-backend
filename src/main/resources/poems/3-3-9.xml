<title>Whistler, after Ingres, Roger Rescuing Angelica</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>'E nel passar vide, mirando a basso,
Angelica legata al nudo sasso' (Orlando Furioso X 92)
The little pot tum, perhaps, though that bull neck, never...
But who, you say, and where, indeed, is Rodge?
Old Roger, synonym Percy, anagram George,
His cheeks all pocked and checked, his engine poxed
Who once was young, who had ponced a magic ring - 
He's off screen, playing id and super ego
Like, trouble with an outsize easel on a windy day,
With regard to this quivering trophy. The point is, I mean the point
Embodies and gets meaning from the plot:
Angelica's here, Andromeda is not.
And Ingres - forget Whistler - all that music,
Did his wife play different women?
Did the model see different men?
Plopped her stays on the couch and said 'No chains,
Cher ma&#238;tre, we'll do this Gangnam style.
The dragon dazzled, she with such aplomb
Romped off on Roger's pillion, he expecting prompt
Reward. As he propped and trussed his gear
She popped his magic ring and - pouffe! - 
He never saw her again.		Ten years ago
In the artist's desk the daguerreotype was found
Of a portrait, now lost, of his first wife,
Long gone. The new wife would have blushed.
