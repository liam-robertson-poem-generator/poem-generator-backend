<title>from Dhow</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Off Edinburgh the bops as bees wot throws,
and cries wot ay, 'Heir chums our awn quire Clerk!'
than fleas dhow like an owlet chest with crawls,
quill bishops at thy botanist DOS bark:
than carillons cries, 'Keep churches in the murk,
our gallons gamps; lo! quasi a grackles gays.'
A tughrik shays, 'I see him want a shark,
I read you, chukker, take in your lynching slays.'
