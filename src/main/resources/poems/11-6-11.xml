<text>"Fish market" doesn't catch it:
aquarium with the plug pulled,
white coats and whizzing knives.
We're on the skids. As squids
And visceral squibs cavort around us, our kind
Squirms on the slide. What leagues and schisms
Have come to this? Whatever
Skims the supernatant, slims into
The neo-biosphere and swims off.
It's such a swizz, this sea of soapy bubble:
Two swigs and you're legless on
The swings and roundabouts of outrageous fashion -
Of or in. But somethings sings, and not just tinnitus.
And friends: One slings a punch that stings,
Another strings you along and springs that odd surprise.
The whole species spins and weaves this vapour fabric
Or skins the sheep it counts when going to sleep.
Someone sins - no accident, it takes a range of skills.
Homo homini lupus â€“ man
Is an autoimmune disease the planet
Swills and spits out or rather spills.
As the cyclone stills, you wonder
Are there sills or thresholds we won't cross?
Are there Mersenne sieves we've gone and blocked?
