<text>The real one raves in dotage
Reigns supreme with drones that raze
In night-shift raids, on time-and-a-half,
Your simples to their allotted ground.
Such are the reins of power: a title,
A raise for dirty work well done.
Machine that runs on rails until it doesn't
And the rains rust it
And the rays of the firmament
Touch it.
