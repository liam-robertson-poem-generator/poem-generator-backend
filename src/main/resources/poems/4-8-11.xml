<text>Maize'd be noise to plant in rows
And stack in tins on shelves
If not for May's happy mayhem.
Then again, that maze is a one-track mind.
If your heart goes out to the beast
The maids and little males it took are gone once more.
But it maims the bereft, that killing,
The nightmares' wet manes in your face,
Unanswerable mails, earth shock from the mains;
Broken not like horses, but as celadon which,
Pieced together again, is here for keeps.
