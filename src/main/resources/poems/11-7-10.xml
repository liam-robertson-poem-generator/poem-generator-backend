<text>She said send for some bennies
And sped. What she'd spend on them spelled
D for zaster. Her nose bled. She stemmed it
With the sleeve of my snazzy suede vest, which perhaps
Smelled of something that caught her distraction. She tracked it
Like a husky and sled. A whole team of them
Swerved off the track. Swelled to a pack
As dinner was served. Could I stay here instead?
