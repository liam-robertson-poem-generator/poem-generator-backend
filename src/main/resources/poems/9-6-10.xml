<title>Redundant</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>He was 'in good tid' this once
He'd timmed his gloom with the tidy bin.
Trimmed and filed his nails as a government
Goon trilled on the box.
Dinner of spuds and tinned
Monosodium glutamate owre the sink
Then tilled the Herald crossword,
Tirled at clues between his teeth
Twirled a biro round his index
Finger till he twigged:
'Turbulent river rose to fill it'?
Reservoir. Not bad.
Though some were tinged with doubt.
He'd worked in a town - a boat-yard, really,
Twinned to the place that
Made the paddle
He was up shit creek without.
