<title>Thyme</title>

<text>What I loved (I see it now) was the dichotomy -
A physical change is reversible, a chemical change is not;
Lab 1 for the perfect tense, lab 2 for preterite -
That I dropped for Russian grammar. Going east
Time loses grip through Turkestan, till China
Has no tense at all: it's red shift and jet lag.
Particles released from a sprig held fast
In three dimensions (index, middle and opposable thumb);
A cloud of tweets that a bird with lungs for heart
Confesses to some notary.
