<title>The Contract (NYRB)</title>
<author></author>
<text>The purpose of the contract is evident:
To allow the sex partners, and indeed the readers
To take pleasure in extreme sexual experience
While remaining essentially nice, considerate
People who have everything under control
	(Tim Parks on 50 Shades of Grey)
Ammar's face is swollen; we see him strung up by ropes,
Waterboarded, sexually humiliated, deprived of sleep
And stuffed into a small wooden box
	(Steve Coll on Zero Dark Thirty)
Zorro fuck dirty, dirty fuck Zorro.
A poliovirus trail goes cold
Around Bin Laden's compound.
Brave women get shot for vaccinating children.
