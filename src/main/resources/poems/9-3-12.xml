<title>Bobo Jojo ("un coup de d√©s...")</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>With taunts and rants he tops the bill
As a tuppeny toss engenders chance.
The talks break down and sex as well
The torse of that particular wave
Reduced to torques and moments.
Toffs are careless. Their accountants,
Less so, calibrated
All the tots and jiggers, monogram troughs.
None of the time-warp Trots can catch them,
Tortfeasors all.
