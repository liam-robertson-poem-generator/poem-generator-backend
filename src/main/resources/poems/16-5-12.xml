<text>Why glance at me in a stranger
Through the glass, the greener grass?
It grants you a keener self;
It grafts an actionable desire on nothing much.
Nothing much: graphs superimposed on graphs
That somehow grasps that's all it is
And gasps at pain and pleasure. Here you are.
Gaps in awareness coin the individual,
Random facts - they don't gas fish in China,
Etcaetera - clownish gaffes in company
That gaffs you with a spike when you don't watch it.
Hurricanes are cloisters where powers meditate.
The eyes are cloistergarths, where wells reflect.
