<text>Booze is essential
Sounds like a plural
Just seeing double
Like four boobs for two
Two boors for one
Fat Boab and the Broons
Play bools on the green baize
Blues on the red blaise. The stupit
Balloons. The readership boos
And turns to the crossword
A rustle of canvas
As booms come about
The boons of saturation sale
Blooms in iron ingot
Get you bigger banner heads
I GOT THE BROOS or
TROUBLE BREWS - my heid, for it
Secretes a bruise
Where rhythm roots. And broods.

Ach but browns and blues are fine in fabric,
Bounds of gold, say, arabesque, or bowers of
Pleached boughs on canvas; the brows of brothers
As their freshest consort
Bows.</text>
