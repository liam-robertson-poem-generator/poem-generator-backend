<text>I was swaddled in satin and held over the font.
A hand emerging from a surplice and soutane held up
A sugar cube absorbing sunlight yellow.
Jags and sacraments punctuated childhood.
The worst was the BCG, that stood for
Ritual circumcision, the scar
Through which we flinched into adolescence.
A jag was also the midnight blue saloon the polis drove.
And it seemed there was a big cat called a jaguar
Because it was the same colour
And it ran just as fast
And it had claws like syringes.
