<text>He's at it.
One big act.
Muffled noises aft would be
The future catching up on him.
He asked for it.
They axed him.
Art is love and skill, it doesn't
Look for applause -
Though its vector might.
There it's: arked and vaulted,
The spectrum arched above it,
Commodified, fat-arsed,
Amped up, maybe
Or wooden apsed and cloistered,
Quiet, apt.
Till ant and termite redeploy it
Crumb by crumb
And my old aunt gets morning mass
In an empty church
Auld kirk, an altar
Native.
