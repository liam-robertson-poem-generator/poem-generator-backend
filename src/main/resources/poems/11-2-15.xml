<text>With every sore a shiny lens
A pulpit for the nerve ends
The punters snore and snort a Christmas-
Cracker spore or two to share.
Why store up riches? What's the score?
Another viral ploy to ex-
Plore. The sower's open hand as floaters soar.
The species now accelerates.
The specimens get slower.
