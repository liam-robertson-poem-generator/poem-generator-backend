<text>"Peking man, Sinanthropus pekinensis based upon about 45 individuals, males
 and females, adults and children, of which no single specimen is complete,
and many consist only of teeth" - Charlesworth.
So it seems they started out as rogue dentition
Clacking about in streams, where they got rejigged by caddis worms,
Or castaneting corries in the Tien Shan to the OM of the aeolian harp,
And things began to lodge between the molars - 
The leg of a snow spider, moss, eagle droppings,
The bald patch of a vulture that had gorged
On a most remote ancestor of the man himself,
And they sort of networked, you know, decay, and organized,
So that presently a bottomless purse was snapping down the mountain
Towards the richer pickings of the plain
And a muscle - more like an oyster, really -
Developed inside the purse and well,
The rest is history
If only oral history.</text>
