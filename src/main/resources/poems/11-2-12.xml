<text>MacDowell soaks in a source
Where the water fairly smokes
En route from ice to vapour.
Someone soaps her back, then it's several
Strokes of budding birch or jessop.
She scopes the tiles and towels,
Stoats a question off the blind, invisible
Japanese masseuse: who stokes the sushi train,
Downloads that music, then sports with me and
Slopes off at dawn?
Remind him, on the wheel of being,
Languor's one of the several deadly spokes.</text>
