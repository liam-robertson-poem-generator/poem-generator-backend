<text>The hurst was a shoal on the river of time,
A knoll in the tangle of space;
The hurt was mortal. The hut was not
That place of hushed
Resonance, a piano's ribcage,
But a clearing hulked and hunched with branches
Pleached as lovers' arms might be,
Where the two of them humped and huffed.
And the hunt was on.</text>
