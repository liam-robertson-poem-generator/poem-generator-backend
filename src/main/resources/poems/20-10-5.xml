<text>As sparks run through the stubble
And a burning cordon inches up the hill this summer night
He's drunk on dead wine
The bad guy with his rented dinner.
Live music at the bar-B-Q
Live bait at the bar
Live ammo, one presumes, in the piece
The grinning barman's groping for.
In walks Simone Weil and orders a shandy.</text>
