<title>Less Sparta

</title>

<text>Poof! As the fluffy cats
Pounce. The mouse's
Guts are puce, as usual.
It's back to epigrams
In the pleasure garden.

But soft! The sour-puss populace,
Unwelcome to this cultural pitch and putt,
The poops and pukes of modernist allusion,
Relieves the Emperor's Warriors of their weaponry
And puts a real blade in the sash of the guillotine.</text>
