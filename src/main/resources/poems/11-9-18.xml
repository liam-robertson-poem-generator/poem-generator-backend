<title>South-Facing Stele</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>The raven took instruction for a thousand years
From Brother North, who one day tried to tell him what to do.
Instruction yes, instructions no, said crow, whose zeal
For selfhood kept him this side of enlightenment,
South of a tantric pass. Look out behind you, Brother North!
But no: the squeal of steel on iron rail. Thy
Corporation come to steal his ministry,
Bros and sisters fled south.
Let them in then seal the col, said the Raven Crown;
Their temporal allegiance is to me, defer to North on larger matters.
But no: good Brother North consoles his kin in every land but Middle Corp
And this.
