<title>Olive (for MC)
</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Where age is beauty, avert the eyes
Or, like Modigliani's chrismic women,
Do without them. Vincent tried to paint you,
Ovid didn't name you in the Metamorphoses;
For Ulysses the sailor man
Tinned spinach was the better part of valour.

Vrubel' caught your cousin's
Lilac aisles of blossom in the isles of wood
Then thought if he could stare until the ides
His eyes would turn to emeralds. Aye
Aye, my dear, not every man can praise you,
But I have made a capo for an old guitar from olive wood
And this will echo in your upper reaches
For a day.</text>
