<title>Loitering within Tent</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>A damp and uncomfortable camping holiday
Army surplus tents. A couple of
Army surplus tenants tagged along
And a jeep thrown in.
You invited us round for drinks
Just the sweat and mildewed four of us. I thought no
Yet that carpeted sunlight, the welcome air
And you in muslin - linen, surely?
I caught the theme: rough canvas, hemp
Then linen; underneath that - silk,
Then what? You wore a hairband. When's
The last time you wore that? Till noon
Mendelssohn's big hit, clang clang like tinnitus.
You're not getting married, are you? Not again?
