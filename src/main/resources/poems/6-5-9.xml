<title>Noises Off</title>

<text>Don't say fart: she's fragrant,
Wrapped in silk and franked in gold
Addressed to the languid audience
But flashed into that revolving door too fast
So now she's faffed in a paper jam
A fact that won't be faxed
Parts of her wedged flat within
The brush-flapped, oak-flanked entry. It ain't over
Till the fat lady sings.</text>
