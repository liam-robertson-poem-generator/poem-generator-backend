<title>First Experimental Contact B-Scanner British Patent no. 863.874 (1958)</title>

<text>The youngest foreman plater on the Clyde
When his youngest (my father) was three, fell to pneumonia
That I, at three, survived to see
Pickled freak friends in this curious
Cabinet, fossil bones and Roman coins but not
Till now the chest for checking
Welds at my father's work, rejigged
To scry cockle mariners such as
My daughter, scanned at the Southern,
Now expert in its use,
Every bit of this Hunterian,
Steam Gothic tor in time
The shade of a sound.
