<text>Whose fault? Who cops the heraldic fyreflaught?
Punters flocked to see him flaunt
His skill with the fraught dice. Can a de-
Frocked bursar be refrocked? Pitch-forked fully vested
Into the silvershod stone font? You'd take that brimming water
For mercury, which it wasn't:
The brim flopped, its milliner not being mad as a.
Leaders fought for the right to foist
Their fossil-fouled cryologies, their needlepoint of frost,
The title deeds being - how to put it? - more than slightly foxed.
