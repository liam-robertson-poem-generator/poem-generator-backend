<title>Pisan Cantos, Voronezh Notebooks</title>

<text>Old Ez folds his blankets
The hoarfrost ebbs to a vision
A mirage of eggs for breakfast
As he errs in the Great Saharan Ergs of
That cantankerosity that
Nothing in him has the strength to break.
The earls of language, dear sir,
Are aye in debt: to usury, I grant; if not -
To work that earns and doesn't buy
This ens reale, the ends of art,
With O.M.'s poems seven years stopped,
Too cold for elm's or almond's root,
Too hard for elves or angels
Two ells in a communal slot.
The light of Glasgow I regret
And will regret the more, or would
If, dead, the dead regret, repine
Error all in the not done,
All in the diffidence that faltered.</text>
