<title>Lib&#233;ration</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Trad jazz, collaborators tarred
And feathered by the brave.
Tanned soldiers hunt black ones
Through the spoils of Paris.
Ghost leather greatcoats from the Hotel Lutetia
Are guten tag'd and tabbed for counter-
Espionage. The French fleet,
A tad late, goes to bombard Indochina.</text>
