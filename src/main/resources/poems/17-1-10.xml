<text>She'd hung out with a crude crowd,
Kind of thing that could cloud your daylights
And did. Pigeons cooed and clattered in the spring
No longer cowed by the hoodies, cowled crows
That toyed with dinner, clowned with carrion.

I could have crowned her, so I could
But ach, she was crewed wi her ain deils
That cruised the organization in her.
She did get cured, smoked out, but they came back
In spades and squads, squared and cubed,

Till she was just a voice, cued for a song,
Wearing that elegant shape with such neglect
We queued around the block to see her.</text>
