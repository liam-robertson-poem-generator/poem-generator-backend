<text>It's as though the future expertly disaggregated things
To present us with each emblazoning its time
That we roil and remix. This would have been My Mother's Birthday,
1st day of spring and of her 90th year (she didn't make 60);
That would be a dipper on a rock in the River North Esk,
Shuddering lambs dot the links above.
This is an old golf ball, found, like a poem, near the bank,
And there's 30 years of peace and health and grandweans that you prayed for
And even started knitting for, but didn't see. They're all good
So happy birthday.
