<title>Esser di certo dei pazzo solenne</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Ariosto! Conkers played on chestnut horses
With jute antimacassars, blazoned silk
And mizzen-mast or telegraph-pole lances
Couched for the joust. And they're off! No late career
As press-box pundit for the also-rans
Who thought they'd duped the bard and jouked the point:
Juiced inside that armour hardly separable for scrap.
