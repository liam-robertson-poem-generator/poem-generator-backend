<title>Braille for Beginners</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Tina's out on bail. Her daddy's rich
Therefore her children shall be rich. Capisc'?
Now whence the lolly... beauty, vigour, youth?
No, yes, no. Connections, guanxi.
Brute force for brains. You should bet a bale of shirts
On this particular horse if you're sure she'd not
Charge on through the hedge when she got to the bend.</text>
