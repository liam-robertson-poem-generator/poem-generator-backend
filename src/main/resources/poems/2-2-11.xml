<title>In the Gods</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>What bodes it
That he who
Bows the fiddle, blows the flute and thumps
The boles of beech with one of those
Fossil hominid femurs fit for hunting
Boars in winklepicker brogues should
Save his breath for cooling bowls of
Brose? He bores us.
No one follows these,
The breadcrumb bourns of his bewilderment.
