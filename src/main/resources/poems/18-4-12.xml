<text>Where poets weigh their wordy husks
And fletchers huss their witty barbs
An occupying army huffs
And humps its body armor.

From prison hulks that lie offshore
A sergeant hunts and fishes.
His little hunks of jailbait cry
That hurts! Don't do that!
In sordid huts he does it all the same.
The same old song, the same rendition.</text>
