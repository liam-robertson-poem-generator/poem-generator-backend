<text>If the eyes were the lamps of the soul and the soul were something
Fished out your nose, a squid, perhaps, doing its daily
Forty laps of the mind till a fingernail lance it,
Emunction flicked in pellet form at larks in the caller air,
Sight would be re-routed to the brain, I think, while the cabling lasts;
The soul would work remotely, anything lax,
Any lapse in faith and morals signalled with sarcastic laughs,
For we know, lass, since Aquinas, that the soul, like seraphim,
Lacks all sense of fun. The good news is
The eyes are the lamps of the body.
