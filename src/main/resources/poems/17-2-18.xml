<text>We got coal for scrap iron from men with horses
My dad's work made boilers. The kettle screamed.
I didn't trust coal: that husky tinkle,
Dirty big jute bags of black false teeth.
In Lourdes School, beside the playground,
Was a coalshed half the size of Ibrox Park.
If you didn't drown in the dunes of coal, at the bottom
You found yourself on the shore of a sacred stream.</text>
