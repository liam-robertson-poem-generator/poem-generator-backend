<title>Per fonte Branda non darei la vista (Inferno XXX)
</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>There are three big, whiskered carp in Fonte Branda
That swim into the focus of Dante's net. Not
The handycam, adrift like a retina, not
Knowledge, that drinks a stream to catch a trout,
But the laurel wind, the dawn wind daily
Reinvent the whorl.</text>
