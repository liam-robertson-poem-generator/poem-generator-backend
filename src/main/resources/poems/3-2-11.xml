<title>Brexit Pursued by a Blair</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Pose as in set down in verse
The pros and amateur cons of referenda
The cons have it
Footnote prose is boring
Poems put the fake in fact
The enquiry probes so gently that it tickles
Blair is back
King of the fucking zombies
One mustn't call them proles
Or give them benefit cuts
Their pores are clogged - that happens
They scratch their back on telegraph poles
When one of them pours a drink, decline
Or look them in the eye
If they have one
Tell them about suffrage
Talk to them about the polls.
