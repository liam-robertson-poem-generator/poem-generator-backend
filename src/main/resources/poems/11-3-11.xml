<text>Old saws and new songs
Toothless smogs chew tasteless bridges
Cloudy swabs
Expunge entitled snobs and sundry slobs
As a housemaid's hoover snogs fitted carpets
In cheap hotels she slogs at it
Fruit scones, she's thinking
Storms in teacups. Perhaps
Yon angel sobs perhaps
Not at particular old squaws but
Over the wondrous rigour of sod's law in the lower orders
And swans off. Swarms of such messengers
Attend the golden hive. Squads of dominations
Squalls of them, by and large unfazed
By mortal static from below. The engine stalls
We drift. Straws
On swelling scrawls of this flood
Silts and sails
That sprawls in its unmade bed
And spawns a million bright green spears of rice to port and thwart.
Shoots and swords, spoils and defence in one
Fisherfolk live in frail with spalls of noise I wield as words for them, not more.
A conscript on his bicycle with camouflage umbrella
And regulation gun.
The skipper solves his obstinate conundrum and we're off
A monk in the bow rearranges his maroon, a second's spinnaker.</text>
