<text>The circus flowed and glittered through the majordomo's hoop,
Till a pantomime horse foaled a pair of clowns
Who fold their arms and say "that eats my lunch!"
This is a thing we can't afford
We canter ford the river of time.
Someone phoned the polisman
Who floored them with his truncheon.</text>
