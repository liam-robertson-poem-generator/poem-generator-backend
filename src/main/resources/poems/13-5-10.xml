<text>The pitch was on the seabed
I was in the net that you had
Slipped in a quiver of shad
And nothing snagged but an intramuscular
Shard of the cold north wind
Jolted my wife from sleep to utter
Dark in a house like a foreign tongue
And that dominican cold north wind
Put what was out there to the test.
Old oak trees are shreiking
I am not, nor have I ever been.</text>
