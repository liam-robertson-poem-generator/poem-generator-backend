<text>This boot-sucking bog mocks whatever
Moat and motte, ditch and dyke
Collapse in it and cancel out.
Sphagnum soaks it up, applies
With a mopstick crammasy lipstick,
As scratchy lichen moists its nib
And sets down verse we praise but
Can't decipher - not that we really need
A middle ground, a ground at all.
We need, I need, moss down on a moth's back
And stars to read as it hoves and switches into them.
