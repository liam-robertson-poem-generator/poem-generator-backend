<text>Too many cooks wring clarty dish-cloots into the Cullen skink
And stir-fry squid in printshop sauce. Too many coots get billed as duck.
Who counts the strain on company croups? The poulterer,
Lord of the coops who sources chicken feed in kitchen cowps?
Unlikely. One of those middle-management crooks that clouts his weans at table?
Neither.
