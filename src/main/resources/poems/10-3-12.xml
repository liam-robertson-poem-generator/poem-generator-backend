<text>The Bruce at Cardross
In rough by the links
Attempts a long-range putt and drops another.
Right. From the sword-rack extracts
A double-fisted broad sword bigger than him
Hunkers down like a Cossack - oi! -
And helicopters bracken. He docks nettles,
Doffs thristles and dots the garth with hacked-off
Limbs and fronds. I mind Cardross.
Not a challenging course. They would say
It's a doss! It's a skoosh! For the Fair
We could stay in the steadings -
Gooseberries and pea-pods under glass.
Cobbled yards, linoleum, iron beds
The dross from coal briquettes
Sugar on sour days.</text>
