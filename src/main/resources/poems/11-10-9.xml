<text>What a sight.
Tar in the slight
Starlight in the shiver
On site hard hat.
The smith'll smite
That flange with a skite
And sparks'll fly in spite
Because or not - but I forgot
The Sprite, its silver breath,
Its three-ton, tincan whisper,
Its ornamental console. So
Forget it. Go
To the striped and spotty workers,
The gossip-sniped and credit swiped.
You tell them: this poem
It's yours. I serve it
Sliced in lines and spliced with syntax,
Spiced with a certain tu ne sais quoi
And spiked with viscous vodka.</text>
