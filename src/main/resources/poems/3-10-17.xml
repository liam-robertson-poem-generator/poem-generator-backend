<text>Clockwork corks! With neither wings
To fly nor weight to cut
Water. They found a slat, their opposite,
Wallowing listless, neither lake nor shore, lined up
And paddled over onto over it, about,
And bobbled back up down again.
They didn't notice the pike
Over a yard long, more than I would lift
Washed up, protruding from the lake like
Handle of butcher's knife from inside pocket
As I've seen, in Paisley, when the pubs came out,
Slit just aft of the midriff, where
A duckling would have gone down nicely.
Thief.</text>
