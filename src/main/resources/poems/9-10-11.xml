<text>The tribes and their tributes,
Their taxes and tithes,
Go on blunt silver tines and gold teeth,
Swinish finery:
Silk twines and tassels and trinkets and ties.

So the sack-cloth kicked in
As the tides can reverse on the mud flats at night;
Cocklers look for old tyres to cling to.
One tries a last call to his wife. Kitchen tiles
Transfer his signal to the rumble of tread
On the sixth urban ring road. It tires her out,
Picking info from acres of echo, the tempers and times.</text>
