<title>Jazz</title>

<text>Feed a roll of paper under the keys of Dolphy's clarinet,
Wing it to Mexico City; let Nancarrow read the chads.
Hmm! There's more to Bach than meets the eye!
He jams that scroll in a mangle, gets his slide rule, awl and fid,
Jabs and jags at it. He's Henry Morse, he's making lace.
Sometime back in Boston Shreffler's stripping and assembling
This Thomson gun archived in a fiddle case.
- Is that Shreff the poet or Shreff the musicologist?
- Shreffler the both. On paper
The music shouts itself down, it jars and charms
Like a rout of chav sopranos. But the instrument's keyed up
As a crossbow. Pull the trigger! See that varmint dance!</text>
