<text>Your man's in fight or flight mode. Nod and smile.
'Whether you can't or needn't, might or must is modal, here nor there.
But did or did you not, now that - '
He moaned a lot, did Moanalot. He mourned
The good old days before they cracked the mould
And maimed him. When Sunday mowed the green.
