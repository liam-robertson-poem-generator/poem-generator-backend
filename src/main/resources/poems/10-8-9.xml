<text>Device: it looked like Hans Holbein the Younger,
Stark as science; date - coming on 500 years ago.
The central shield was empty; angels' faces
Vied with hidden forces for control.
Emblems that draped the horrid vacuum
(Some cover-up on innocence made to pay)
Were probably not symbolic, but mnemonic:
Magic memory theatre; forgotten play.</text>
