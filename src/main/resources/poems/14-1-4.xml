<title>A Dacha near Leningrad

<text>A shaft of stone
With a liquid lens
Sorceress
What do you see
In the well of the stone
In the stone of the well?
Wild swans.
A day on the dacha
Quartered together
Under the heat.
Circle the horizon. Look!
Exclamatory puffs of smoke
For pines and birches.
A wooden trap in the smoky trees.
Lift the stone, open the door:
Cold bright darkness facing up
Through the flattening heat.
In the well of the woods
In the woods of the well
Mister seer, what do you see?
A quiet ward of rheumy-eyed
Expectorating old men watching
The television's lovely face.
A low serai on December dunes.
Go to the glass meniscus, see
A room with a lamp and a stove and a cat
And the four of us in company
In the plumb of the snows
In the vertical winter.</text>
