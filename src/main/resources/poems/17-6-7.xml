<text>Kith is thicker than water,
Thicker than porter, older than blood.
A crith of a life will last - a slither of
Gold from the lith of a finger
Into the zither of the tilth,
Found by a smith in the horse's mouth.
The filth is buried with us, and our rhythm
Dithers and goes. The pith of our decision
Withers out by the fifth or sixth "begat".
If anything survives the hither and
Thithering waters of - it's pure gold, pure myth.</text>
