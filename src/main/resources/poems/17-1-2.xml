<title>X cubed
</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Where parallels meet, the cube becomes
A sphere in placid orbit.
The die is an imperative that never comes to rest
Where Y is latitude, alliteration, start of a sound
And X is longitude, rhyme, a syllable's end,
Let Z be the changing light from equinox to equinox,
Vocalic play on assonance of place
So that when I'm asked But daddy, what's the matter?
I'll can say
That who and you and I will meet again or maybe not,
Not "Nothing much", the which, while strictly accurate,
Isn't true.</text>
