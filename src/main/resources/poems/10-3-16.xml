<title>Dog /Gyp</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Tongue tripping him
Barking his brains loose
Crotch-otrope
Scared silly by the aliens in his nose
Stuck between pursuit and usufruct (he won't
Give up the ball), anxious as a linesman, yet,
Out walking, seized of a stick, happiness is.
Ours was never house-trained
Nor bit back at kicks or yanks on the leash.
Sister got it, mum looked after it,
Dad had it put down. No way
To treat a guest. No way to be.
