<text>Can't Buy a Thrill
Now let's consider, for the sake of argument,
Since you're an argumentative little rotter,
That greying men have their corny sensitivities
And you're not the prosecution, but my daughter.
Objection! Sustained. But would you hear me through?
"Afraid of living" - that's your latest taunt,
And I think - but didn't I help them feel at home
By hacking down my sweet or bloody wants?
Or was that just me appeasing Holy Rome?
I've flourished in love, and I've wished I was dead,
And I've broken the rules that held me together.
And oddly enough, I'm still here. I look round:
In spite of it all, I fear nothing and no one.
If I'm alive, it's in my fear for you.</text>
