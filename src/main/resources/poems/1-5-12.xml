<text>The ass, to the thistle, is ax and pestle.
Bristle its arse. Great arcs of piss. So much
For Scotland's sign on upturned arks, the apse
Of kirks, the printer's arts on acts of parliament.
It's THERE as literal ants in a hexameter
Are not, nor the rhythm of rock songs in plywood amps;
Up there in mythic force with the Alps, with the asps
Of Asculapius, here it's â€“ rendered down to veggie gristle.
Yet Cleopatra asks and they prepare for her
A bath of ass's milk.
