<title>Class Consciousness</title>

<text>The history teacher
Asking round the class
Where we're going our holidays:
With bucket and spade,
With pail and shovel
To the beach at Rothesay
Warded by Polaris
Submarines. Watching
The investiture
Of the peely-wally
Prince of Wales.
Me reading War and Peace.
