<text>Sense along the wires. Sounds
Across them. Broken dolls
Wives of the wind in cuckold bungalows
The backroad numbers and un-
Winds in shale laid down for Georgic
Wines of an age where the line no longer
Whines its whats and whys. Till then
She whiles in whist, her wiles
Underemployed. Out in the wilds.
No word to the wise.
