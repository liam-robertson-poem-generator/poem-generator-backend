<title>Arcadia</title>

<text>Bucolic yes idyllic no
They all lambed at once
Honed on winter wind, the pack
Was onto them like 'land ahoy!'
With fire, a drystane fold and a squad
Of berserk dogs in place, the shepherd lad.
Below, a cellar's stocked, a boiler lagged
For a lard and worsted corporation.
