<title>Alphabetical psalm (for Pietro Cardines)
</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Nun:	The yoke of his bones weighed down on him
The wife never sent a chaplain. The widow
Left him to the mortuary and the dead.
Only one relative
Saw him lifted from the slab -
In parachute silk?
For the airforce had got wind of this
And a guard of honour came.
And no one wept in church, except
One officer, who couldn't stop.
What got to him? What
Was his name? The frailty
Of the fighting man.</text>
