<text>Sixteen men on a dead man's jet is odd, but understandable.
Better would be sixteen men and a dead man's jest "har har, there was no treasure".
But sixteen men on the cabin trunk or thorax of a dead gent -
That's the roof of a bus in Bangalore, or
Cycling in tight circles with the wobbling
Smile of a wedge of acrobats.</text>
