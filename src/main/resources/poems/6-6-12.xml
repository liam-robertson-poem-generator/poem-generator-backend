<text>I'll fix you captions to imagined flicks,
Supply the flints and tinder for a lantern
To launch a shimmering skiff in your picture house,
Fits and starts of sense that flits
A little beyond your reach. It flirts with you.
Be a bit less stiff,
Stop making pocketfuls of fists
In that raincoat no one frisks
(The filth has other stuff in mind:
In fifths and syncopation the chase-scene flips,
He gets away. The feds get just the spilth.)
