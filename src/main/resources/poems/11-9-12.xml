<title>Concrete Sound</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Sweeps in sneaks out or vice versa.
Orthodontal squeaks and streaks of print. He
Speaks but doesn&apos;t say what good he seeks,
Maybe a jeep, seats four on leather
Three-piece suites to cruise the streets.
Or maybe a negotiated cease-fire.
Grey water seeps as somebody steeps and wrings
Steeps and wrings. The plumbing never sleeps.
And these ants in chitin crinolines
Running on their elbows. Stop it!
