<text>It mows, the mauves - 
Little moss-troopers - fall,
Marsh mallows and spikes,
More's the pity. Great moles
Of rubble shock the hissing
Swell; they fall too.
What moans in the rigging
Moans also in pain
These are modes of crisis,
Rejection.
But THIS is what mourns
When what moulded us once
Lets us down
And moulds us again.
