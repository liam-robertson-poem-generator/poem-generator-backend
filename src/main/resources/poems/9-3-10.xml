<text>The pack fanned out
Dogs toiled and drooled
Their noses trawled the ether
For a hint of fox. No grand sommelier
Who ever toyed with blood-red juice in crystal
Envisioned the molecular implications
They took for read. The groom
Togged up for slaughter trod behind them:
Toddle dumb kens tod'll dee.
