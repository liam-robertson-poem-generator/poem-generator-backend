<text>So: rhythmic tics and fisticuffs
With trysts of mind and matter,
Plosive tricks and perverse twists
Passed on by egregious tits and nameless
Twits, till it trips and falls at length
In digital ticks and crosses.
You'll tell, I trust, how 'tints
Of alizarin, rose madder and straw'
Tips the balance for us,
Tilts us from the brink.
