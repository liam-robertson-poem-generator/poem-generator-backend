<text>Ghouls are rendering bone that glues their grander lies together.
Next for Shaving growls and glowers, but he's helpless
As the goons move in, as the gnus (mind how you pronounce that)
Stampede. Nil Nisi Bonum sometimes grues at slandering the dead,
But they've no grounds for redress. He gowns up
And grooms the judge. We're talking damaged goods, your honour.
His honour grooves to the beat, to the drumming on empty gourds.
