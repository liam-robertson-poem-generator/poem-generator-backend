<text>The banns are read, the groom brags
I got Morka! Platinum bands get swapped
He bags the dowry. Bras and pants of listed
Brands no longer cover one prosthesis
And one dysfunction. Oh well.
But sure the little barbs and balms of medicine ...?
I see. He bans all mention. Someone blabs. The nation's
Bars hear talk of nothing else till the football game.
Barns are full of wind. The chaff
And bran's been sold with the wheat, as bards proclaim
Morka the big stick, Morka
The biggest pussy of them all.
