<text>On the short leet but never chosen
He leeched and poulticed with the best
And like the rest had not the least
Clue. They leafed through grimmories
Leashed to library stalls in college quads
On land they never should have leased
Where something insensible
Leaked from a catafalque
That the groundwater leached.
