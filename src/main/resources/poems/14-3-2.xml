<text>Lust will rob you of your innocence
Age relieve you of your lust;
Death of course will then assuage
Or abrogate old age. Sort of.
For innocence can outstare lust
Which can defer or ridicule age
And though death does for age and lust
It can't touch innocence.
Can't touch anything really:
Its spurious personality looms
In the death of innocent creatures.
