<title>Quarry</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>A wheeze in the jakes: light a tuppeny banger,
Roll it under the door. Forgettable japes,
The bits and patches, chapes and senses
Time chafes and uses, cuts to the quick - 
However so the deer cannot outdistance
Innards heaped on its hide for dogs to tear
Whenever it is one cuts to the chase.
