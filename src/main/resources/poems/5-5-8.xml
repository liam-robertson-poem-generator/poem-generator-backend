<title>Ulysses Didnt Play the Sax like Jackson Pollock</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>Now the Iliad doesn't have him as an avant-garde performer,
But nor does it feature an equine installation,
So I'm wondering if the original said 'Ulysses was in the van'
As in vanguard, and somebody else thought  delivery van,
Now what would the Trojans get delivered? Not Guinness or Milanda;
Mibbe horse meat? The French went in for that.
And then somebody else said but they didn't have vans in antiquity;
Maybe it wasn't horse meat: what if it was a horse?
But how could you hide Ulysses in a horse?', and on it went.
