<text>Bees knocked off course in beams of wind. Motes
Bumble in light that breathes on glass
And rubs it. A bright breeze focuses,
Intones its three-day breves, one for every wood,
For each field of beans, for the grass, its beards and javelins.
Two beers for every place we've seen the last of, liked or not!
What though the bamboo's yet to sprout
For our biodegradable caskets.
The species breeds, the specimen bleeds.
Time beads in the still.
