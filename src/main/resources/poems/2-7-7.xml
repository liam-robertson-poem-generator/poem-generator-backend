<text>Beth, a home for me, first consonant,
Landfall where waves abrade the coins of snow,
Cut larch happed round a stone hearth.
Breath, yours, from its own ocean
Whose breadth, whose frightening breadth
Swells in a corner of your eye.
Berth - the sailor has, however squalid,
But this ship has none.
