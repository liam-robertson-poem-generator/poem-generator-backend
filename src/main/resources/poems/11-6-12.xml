<text>Smith's orphaned. Scliffs along on skateboard skiffs.
He tokes his vapid spliffs. He sniffs, and stiffs the neighbours. Later
Sifts his options: the Swiss could sort him out; swifts
Could tell him about migration, stirps and territories. Meantime
He strips the paper in his room, that echoes empty, where
The toaster sneezed. He snips his nails, sips tepid, milky tea,
Slips on his mask and hoodie. Skips a beat. The script's
Not patently for him: cisgender romcom skits for trouser-swapping
Squirts, where the camera squints at what's in skirts.
Hikikomori like it with canned laughter. Cysts of untact,
Biological bubbles in the mix. A circus act, then: SMITH GETS HIS STILTS:
Sits on his hams and splits the seams. Spits on his palms and slits his shoes.
Splints a couple of bow-sprits from the nearest yacht club (still a tad
Far fetched), sprints or staggers where it all silts up
And since he doesn't swim, well, he sinks. Down there it stinks.
For rescue workers, this stint's the short straw or snorkel.
And what do they find in the brackish boondocks, in the sticks?
Skinks. Another reptile slinks away. A rusty sphinx that smirks at them.
Where are you, Smith? The bunker-fuel slicks; each rescue-service lamp
(There's six of them) sicks and cuts the aspic gloom in sixths, till one of their
flippers snicks his cheek. They haul him up. You won't do THAT again?
