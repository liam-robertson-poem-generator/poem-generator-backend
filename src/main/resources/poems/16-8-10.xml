<text>I gauged the distance
And gained momentum
Nursing a close-grained, wooden bullet
Stitched in boot-grade bullhide
That grazed the pitch and hurtled at the batsman.
All adrenalin - but not enough - he gazed at the bad
Bounce. The picadors hung around in
Biker gear and glazed expressions.
His bat - a glade of willow trees, indeed - can't
Save him now. He glared and whacked it back.</text>
