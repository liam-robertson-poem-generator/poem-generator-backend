<text>Three tanned and silver samurai
With their cutlery in golf bags
Vintage Harley saddle on the horse
We were off to the war.
Me with just a big lance
Looking to get maimed or amputated.
At his bus stop the sound technician left us
We were joined by one of my students
No backing out now, what though
Not only had I nothing to prove
But there WAS nothing to prove
Proof being a factor of tautology
So more or less redundant. Banzai.
