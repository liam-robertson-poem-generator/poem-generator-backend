<text>A ship was broached,
Stern flipped over the beaked prow
And beached on a lee shore.
No sign of crew; the coastguard
Briefed the press and beefed up the night watch.
Nothing beeped or flared in rafts
Nor bleeped on the radar.
There's always a beat: your pulse,
The relenting tide, a stubborn
Blank where there should be footsteps.
All we found on board was some poor
Beast that would bleat no more,
Bleached and briny. It was
Braxy and brawn with vinegar beet for tea.
