<text>Tough stuff, time, that won't
Bend back. It tucks you in like milk:
You're stuck. When the truck struck
A poor scrunt was rearranged
As though the dying - only them and then -
Brailled, like baby mammoths' trunks,
Eternity, that turfs them out. Alone for now,
We cry big turpentine tears. The ram tups,
No more in love than it bleats in tune;
Wouldn't dream of Mary's little tough
Two tufts and you're gruff. A couple of
Pantomime Turks in fez, truss and skirt. This circus,
The rusty trickster turns up trumps.
