<title>Navvy Lope
</title>
<author>Peter McCarey</author>
<text>What navigator shovels with a rudder?
Frowned McCarey, who ploughed a wake before the hull
To lock it in the landscape.
A furrow deep enough to sow with totty boats and churches,
Manhattaning in March then going to spore.

A railway cutting rubbles with a shudder.
Who dat lope
Across a skyline once upon a West?
That interloper!
Sitting in a barber chair still chewing his cheroot.
The cartel delegates its rest
To trigger and escapement.
Lily's planning her elopement.</text>
