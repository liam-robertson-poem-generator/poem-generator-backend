<text>The green  going down to the pond got trimmed
With this cast-iron mower.
Skipping-rope handles, clutch and toy brake
And a diesel more like for a car
Or an army submersible, instead of that
Big concrete roller. I told him,
I did: if it runs away don't
Brake. Slip the clutch, swing it round.
Did I say 'submersible'?
Freudian slip.
